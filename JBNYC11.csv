It is fine if you are up to this, but just you need to know, this place is no way close to a hotel room, the place is a living room and divided in the individual rooms and you see a grid (open) to the ceiling of the (big) living room, so, it is again fine if you are up to this, but not sure if you wanna spend about 80 $ for this space plus it is in the strange neighbourhood.. I must be honest that I was welcomed nicely and the food and everything else is free to share, and plus it is religious place so you will see everywhere some sign of that. True or not the guy told me that the profit goes to homeless, if that is true and I know it, then it is ok not \\'wasting\\' money - but I have no proof of that yet. Well, I rated this place poor for the conditions that you might like to consider the price and the facilities you will get.. I think it is highly rated - I would expect that if it is less than 60 $ and true that the profit goes to homeless, and ready to sleep with someone else\\'s doorstep and hear a lot (although it is forbidden to make noise and no alcohol is allowed, but still people make noise when they sleep right?) of strange sound..

Check in was easy and was greeted in a timely and friendly manner. You can tell it\\'s a brand new hotel by how clean and modern it is and by the tile on the floors. Me and husband reserved a studio and asked for highest floor available and was given a studio on the 4th floor so pretty much no view but that was not an issue for us. The room was pretty clean however having just renovated our own home we can tell some things weren\\'t completely finished. The tiles in the bathroom still needed the thin set to be cleaned off and the corking was all over the place. The floor in the bathroom felt like cement so we just put  two bath mats down. Shower pressure was great. There was pretty much anything you would find in a long stay hotel including stove fridge with freezer, microwave, dishwasher with all utensils and pots a pans needed for cooking. The bed was comfortable and they do have blackout shades. I loved that they had two flat screen tvs so my husband could watch his ESPN show while I caught the news in the morning. The only negative for the room is the outlets weren\\'t next to the bed so my phone was plugged in but not in reaching distance from the bed. There were two outlets behind the bed but we would\\'ve had to move the bed out.

This was my second stay at the AKA Wall Street.  The first time was absolutely fantastic with a nice one bedroom suite and a competitive price.

After 30 minutes, it emerged that the staff did not have the necessary training to make a new reservation in their system for me.  I even provided them my e-mail confirmation.  They kept blaming Expedia, but as the customer, I could care less, I had fully pre-paid the reservation for four nights.  And I was tired, just sort it out!  I asked for the manager, who arrived 20 minutes later.  In the end, I stood (there are no seats in the lobby) with my luggage for exactly 62 minutes while the three staff members sorted out my reservation and gave me a key to access my room.  I have never, in my entire career as a global, long-haul traveler, waited so long from arrival to room entry.  The staff were apologetic, but clearly were not trained, moreover they literally could not complete the most basic of functions - process a reservation.  They upgraded me to their largest room, a two bedroom suite which was totally unnecessary and also not wanted (I was traveling alone, I don\\'t need all that room).  The next day my WiFi password expired, when I called downstairs, I was told by the snarky attendant &quot;We thought you were leaving since you were so unhappy yesterday.&quot;  I couldn\\'t believe the audacity of the staff members at this hotel.

Initially, we were not happy as we had a room that was at the back of the building and it was very dark and gloomy.  I requested a room that was brighter, and as soon as a room became available, we were moved to a much nicer room, 807, which was at the front of the building and had lots of closet space.  So here are the positives of the property from my perspective:  clean rooms, comfortable beds, adequate kitchen facilities (see my suggestions below), great staff who were ALL very helpful, informative, and friendly (Sebastian, you\\'re the best!!), the washing and dryer room (free to the guests!!), the gym, and the business centre.  Also, it rained a lot while we were there, and there were always plenty of umbrellas.  The negatives were the subway train runs below the building (not a &quot;train\\' smash, as eventually, you get used to it and stop hearing the noise and feeling the rumble); the fact that you don\\'t get daily cleaning service unless you pay extra for it (given the cost of the hotel, the cleaning service should be included in the price); the towels provided are not the best quality; and there is nothing to put your laundry in to carry it to the laundry centre.  My suggestions to make the place even better and more like a home away from home are as follows:  (1) add a laundry basket or bag to each room; (2) provide softer towels; (3) consider creating an area on the top floor where the daily coffee is provided called &quot;The Pantry&quot; where guests can leave their non-perishables to be used by incoming guests, and certain kitchen items can be borrowed and returned; and (4) a laundry washing service (an option for an additional cost).  When I left, I took with me the salt, pepper, garlic salt and cinnamon that I bought while there.  However,  I would have preferred to have left them for another guest to use while there.  Also, it would have been nice to have had a measuring cup, measuring spoons and some baking dishes.  As these types of items may not be commonly used by guests, they could be made available in &quot;The Pantry&quot; on an as needed basis. \\n\\nAll in all, it was a great stay.

Unfortunately there is no coffeemaker in the room.\\n- Excellent water pressure in the shower\\n\\nCONS:\\n- The A/C unit is loud.  Woke me up at night when it turned on; and when it\\'s on you need to raise the TV volume\\n- Very small bathroom -- primarily because the door opens into the bathroom.  \\n- The shower leaks onto the floor because they have adopted one of those European &quot;half a window to cover half the bath&quot; things that only cover half the bathtub.  Less tacky and more sanitary than a curtain, but less effective.\\n- Poor views from the room, but that\\'s the norm in NYC\\n- Shampoos and body washes were too small, which is consistent with the trend in most hotels now \\n- No door stop on the wall next to the front door, so front door hits the wall when it opens\\n- Library is a little bit of a wasted opportunity.  Should be more pods/tables for individuals to work from.  Probably would be a good place to add a coffee shop, too.  \\n\\nOverall, I really liked it and will definitely return.   \\n",4,positive

So very little sleep that night. Next day asked to move, and after threatening to cancel rest of the stay the suddenly were able to accommodate my request. Went to the acclaimed &quot;state of the art&quot; gym, which consisted of 3 cardio and some dumbbells in 2 hotel rooms, where you could not have 2 people training at the same time as we would not fit. The fridge contained no water, actually no water whatsoever in the gym. The alarm in my room went off in the middle of the nigh, and I was in three rooms and none of the clocks were set at the correct time. Funny example of the lack of detail at this hotel. Put my laundry bag on the bed, with filled out form, as I normally do during my 100 hotel night a year, but for the first time ever, they did not take the laundry, so it was still in the plastic bag when I got home late at night and really needed the clothes the next day. Rooms are super spartan and a bit hostel like in its feel with better quality. The most positive thing is the staff, they are really friendly and trying their best, but honestly - I spend 1/3 of my life in a hotel and this was a truly interesting experience that I will forever avoid and I chose this hotel as I love trying new ones and this is a bit like &quot;the emperors new clothes&quot; type of hotel.

But it\\'s NYC, so it\\'s cool. The staff at the door and check in were friendly, welcoming and attentive, so perfect on that score. The room was good, decent size with a nice bathroom. We had breakfast in the &quot;Library&quot; which was a bit strange, as it\\'s more like a study and a wait staff takes your order. Took long to get the food, and it was hotel priced (a bit $$), but was very good. I don\\'t mind overpriced hotel food when it\\'s prepared as well as this breakfast was. The only beef I had was that the windows weren\\'t soundproofed enough to block out the constant honking and sirens on Canal Street. But it is a &quot;cool&quot; look, the staff was outstanding and it was a great location for us. Oh, and the two fitness rooms are very small but top of the line Cybex machines and Hampton dumbbells.

On check in I was given the wrong room due to trying to check in customers too quickly, and not being able to clearly see who is with whom.  On check out they still had not cleared the account of the last gentlemen that had checked out, and had to make me wait whilst they ran after him. Water is available in reception to take on your days out. A tablet is ion the room to make calls and order room service etc.\\n\\nRoom 310 is a double bedded room and has very little space between the end of the beds and the table.  I bruised my legs 7 times in 3 days.  My very slim daughter also banged her knees due to lack of space. No tea facilities in the room, and although the hotel has room service expect high end 5 star prices.  The hotel bar closes early as it becomes a night club and in room 310 you could hear the music in the bathroom and the heavy vibration from the early subway trains which lessens but continues throughout the day.  Lovely robes and toiletries in the room and it was clean.  The room does not have enough electrical sockets, 2 only and these are located in the alarm clock. The room on arrival was quite dark and the staff member was not aware that all lights have a separate dimmer switch.\\n\\nThe hotel is located with an easy 10 minute walk to Little Italy that has some great Italian restaurants that have sensible and lower than average prices. \\n\\nThe staff were friendly and helpful, but when I moved to another 5 star hotel I then realised how much work the Howard need to take on board to improve and provide value for money. as the Howard was more expensive and delivered less than some other great 5 star options.

So I sat around for three hours, one of them unnecessarily since my room was ready which I was sitting around.  \\nTHe bump in the road after that was that they hadn\\'t brought my luggage to the room either, so there\\'s that. \\nHowever, I was ready to forgive all that because everyone here is so nice but - there\\'s an additional part to this narrative that is a failure of the hotel that ruined my trip.  Call me sensitive, but I guess I\\'m not used to being insulted my a hotel., \\n\\nSpecifically, this evening, I  had a lovely meal outin the neighborhood with my brother, and part of the hotel experience that is advertised by 11 Howard in its promotional literature  is that there is a trendy bar attached, called &quot;The Blond&quot;, and which I was looking forward to as part of closing out the evening visit with my brother. \\nExcept, when we waited at the velvet ropes, hello, the bouncers didn\\'t even bother to look up at me. \\nNow, I know I\\'m just a simple person from a small provincial town (San Francisco) and not trendy or important  (I manage money)  and was just looking for a night cap at a trendy new york bar that\\'s attached to the hotel who was refused service but the bar is advertised in all of the hotel literature as being an amenity of the hotel, which makes it downright deceptive and fraudulent. Perhaps discriminatory too, since I\\'m an old person who is a member of a racial minority,\\nIt\\'s insulting to all guests if the hotel is good enough to take your money but not gracious enough to let you in for a drink. \\nMy company has offices in NYC and I\\'m responsible for a budget and a staff who does business here regularly, but this is on my &quot;NOT RECOMMENDED&quot; list - how can a hotel insult its guests in this manner?  It\\'s inexcusable, embarrassed me in front of my brother, and ruined my stay,\\nI\\'m fuming as I write this but this place gets what it deserves. \\nI\\'m being generous by giving it two stars, since the water in the shower is hot and the sheets are clean. \\nOh, and the gym?

I\\'m a loyal Starwood hotels member, and when I have them visit me in New York I typically have them stay uptown at Le Parker Meridien. However since the recent tie-up with Design Hotels for SPG members to take further advantage of the loyalty program I decided to book a room at 11 Howard, about which I\\'ve heard good things (it also happens to be a mere few blocks from where I live in SoHo).\\n\\nMy parents expressed having a wonderful stay at 11 Howard, thanks in particular to Cristian on the 11 Howard &quot;Creators&quot; team who was able to get them on the penthouse floor away from any ground floor noise. I checked on my parents\\' behalf to inspect the room and make sure it was fit for them; upon doing so I mentioned to the attendant at check-in that they were celebrating their anniversary. When my parents finally got in, they found a bottle of Prosecco from the hotel for them to celebrate their special occasion. At the end of their stay they shared that all the staff they interacted with during their stay at 11 Howard were courteous, professional and always willing to offer their assistance.\\n\\nBased on my own interactions at 11 Howard, the establishment appears to be a well-run hotel with decent sized rooms (for NY especially) whose sparse design and decor make it highly economical in space. The lack of a &quot;front desk&quot; was actually a surprisingly nice touch, removing the hassle and wait from the typical hotel check-in process. The staff - both the attendants on the ground floor and the custodial staff - were always welcoming and pleasant, always offering their service and assistance. The location is another great benefit of staying at 11 Howard: while fairly centrally located in SoHo, it still feels removed enough from the activity of Little Italy, the craziness of Broadway, and the bustle of Chinatown (but entirely accessible at the same time).\\n\\nI\\'ve seen reviews here that call the hotel trendy, and while to a degree that may be true, I actually consider 11 Howard a very minimalistic boutique hotel.

Here\\'s the catch, rooms are really small and the room service menu is limited with food coming to your room in cardboard to go bags. I love design and modern style but come now, all your food in paper bags/boxes like you have left overs? Lastly I must say the beds are fantastic though but the walls are super thin.

I did not remember the girl\\'s name who helped me but she was very friendly, helpful, provided details about the bar, etc. and made check in seamless.\\n\\nI had reserved a Deluxe King bed since there were no Double Doubles left in the city and I knew we would at least have a few upgrades to help with the bed issue. When I got to the room, it was simple, yet elegant. The fruit was a little odd, as there was only 1 pair, 1 orange, 1 tangerine and 3 strawberries. Usually you get 2 of each since he was aware that I was being joined by my son. And if you can put some plastic wrap around them, they stay fresh longer. We were staying 4 days so I knew we just needed to keep them covered. They came in very handy, though, and having worked in hospitality, I always found that was a very helpful thing to put in people\\'s rooms. \\n\\nI always unpack everything and had no problem with the number of hangars or the one pull drawer for my stuff. I did have table, a bench seat and a single chair as well. There is a tablet that should be used for ordering things inside of the hotel as well as locator service, but the map would never render. We also were not in checked into that room so the tablet showed that we coudn\\'t order food without calling down to the Front Desk (per the Tablet) and then they transferred me over to Room Service. I ordered the Angus burger with all of the fixings and french fries. It was delivered fast, hot and in a really cute box and in a handled bag, instead of on a tray. Again, this was a really great tough and very &quot;folksie&quot;. \\n\\nI did go to the bar the first night and waited for my son to arrive. Frank was my bartender. He wasn\\'t having the greatest night after his uncle became ill, but he rallied and was so helpful to us. He directed us where we could go have dinner (Blue Bonnett) and we made reservations there. The Manager of that restaurant waited on us personally and the food was incredibly good. Frank was really just a fun and helpful bartender. \\n\\nThe next day I needed to print out tickets for the Knicks game. I think it was Kenny? who was at Concierge / Guest Services. He was also very helpful. Unfortunately we could not get the tickets to print and had to call in Mark from IT to help. Eventually he just had to print the tickets down in the General Manager\\'s office. There was no disc space left on the computer and had multiple errors. The laptop definitely needed some TLC to reimage or remove some of the items from the laptop. Eventually we got it fixed and we were off on our travels. \\n\\nMy son and I LOVED the bed as it was so soft and inviting. I liked that I could warm up the room with my own thermostat after freezing at the Macy\\'s Day Parade. We definitely needed some warmth and a nap. The only other thing that was odd was the door man wasn\\'t ever at the door, but eventually he would come running as we were already through the door. The other fun thing was we ran into Kenny? the last night, who was working the door for a private party and he gave us both a big hug like we were long lost friends. I love that kind of service and I felt like I was staying in my own building with Concierge in Providence. I really love good and personalized service. Mark also came to my aid and remembered my name and I just loved how different this hotel felt. Everyone was able to communicate via headsets and it seemed like you were able to do a lot with not as many people. It also helped if they were cross trained so they could fill in at multiple roles. All in all I would give them an A-plus on just about everything. I especially loved that housekeeping didn\\'t pound on our door each morning. We were able to come and go as WE needed to without being woken up because of our strange hours. But our room was impeccably cleaned everytime we returned. They asked late in the day if there was anything else we needed. The only other recommendation I would make is you must have more electrical outlets in the room. If two people are staying in there the only charger is on one side of the bed. You need to have access for both sides of the bed to charge phones, computers, etc. without getting in each other\\'s space. We ended up with piles of phone cases charging, charger boxes, computer, etc. all on one side of the bed, which was a pain if I didn\\'t want to wake my son up in the morning. I would also move the outlet in the bathroom up 1/2&quot; so you can plug in both the hair dryer and a curling iron at the same time. Lastly, the shower was very nice, but needed to be hotter. Also with the European style glass, if you use the hand held sprayer you run the risk of getting it outside of the shower and the floor mat soaked. The toiletries were amazing though and we loved the lava rocks/oil and smells that permeated in the halls of the hotel.\\n\\nWe truly cannot wait to go back!",5,positive

Except NYC rooms are tiny, loud, and very expensive.  Value in a NYC hotel room is hard to find.\\n\\nI found 11 Howard in a search through the SPG website for a room for a business trip.  I hadn\\'t stayed there before, but the rate was at least $100 cheaper than any other reasonable SPG room in the city for the night.  It\\'s in a good SoHo location, and there was good taxi presence in the area.  The check in is sort of modern pretentious.  There\\'s no desk, per se.  There\\'s a round table where airily-dressed staff sweep in and check you in via tablet.  They make a big deal about not having food (minibar) in the rooms, so they give you a bottle of water in the lobby.  So, in addition to your bags and your room key, you also have to juggle the bottle of water.  How about stop trying so hard to be chic/different and just put the water in the room.\\n\\nThe place has a warm vibe.  Wood floors in the elevator, and the room.  Earthy tones.  The room was small. I couldn\\'t get the door to the &quot;closet&quot; open at the same time as the door to the bathroom.  It was one of those closets that is so shallow and partitioned that your shirt and pants can\\'t hang without hitting the shelf that\\'s midway down.  Plus, they only have the tiny ironing board with the four-inch legs.  This drives me crazy.  If you\\'re going to go to the trouble to give me a board and an iron, give me a full-size board.  \\n\\nAll that being said, the room was comfortable,had everything I needed (except the full-size board), and was clean.  The bed was very comfortable.  The shower smelled musty, but everything worked.  \\n\\nThey have tablets in the room through which you contact the concierge service and order room service AND....minibar packages.  Whatever.\\n\\nI liked this hotel.  It is in a good location for access to downtown, without having to stay downtown.  I ended up walking down to World Financial Center.

Super friendly doormen is a nice way to arrive/leave. The reception area itself is basically one big room with tall ceilings and a big round table. You\\'re checked in by someone using a tablet. It worked fine for us, but does feel a bit awkward. In particular, if there\\'s more than one party waiting to check in (or just wanting to ask something) there\\'s no way to queue up so it gets a bit frustrating. Don\\'t care for it. \\n\\nThe room is nice (some reviewers have called it scandinavian in style with plenty of blond wood and that seems about right). It all feels new which is nice, but the rooms are .... a bit tight. We had a Howard deluxe room and although we didnt feel claustrophobic we did both react to the diminutive size (although the bathroom, hallway and closet were nicely sized!). Minor quibbles would be that the big closet only held maybe 4 hangers and no iron (tho staff were very prompt in bringing it to us on request). There\\'s a really nice sitting area (the library) with light service (dont need to buy anything) where you can hang out and read/work. It\\'s one floor up which seems to help it stay less busy (i.e. you can get somewhere to sit easily).\\n\\nSo, would we stay here again? We didnt find much else that we liked when searching for a place in this area, however I think we\\'d look around to see if there\\'s anything else we could try. With that said, overall it\\'s a nice place to stay and partly dependent on what the going rate is (NYC can get quite pricey).",4,positive

That\\'s conscious hospitality at its best. \\n\\nThe following day, I called the front desk to have my AppleTV set up as there are no streaming services in this hotel and was flatly told NO, that it was not possible. Then I had a call back from someone else on the front desk advising that they were finding a work around for this. In the end it was possible, so why tell me no in the first place? \\n\\nThe food and beverage manager promised to send up a couple of juices for my trouble, as he became involved in getting my AppleTV set up. The juices never arrived. \\n\\nHaving had so much trouble, I contacted the GM to express my disappointment with the service received. The GM tried to make it up to me by providing a $100 voucher to a nearby store and advised me that he would have juices sent up daily for the duration of my stay. He also offered a session at HigherDose which I did not use. The GM also arranged for me to be moved to a 5th room for the stay, which finally had a tub and a view uptown. \\n\\nUnsuprisingly, the juices stopped coming, more emails were exchanged with further disappointment. While I appreciate his efforts to look after me and reach out multiple times, it was disappointing that my experience continued to decline. \\n\\nI don\\'t understand how there can be so many elements of failure in this hotel. The hotel claims to be \\'conscious hospitality\\' however the team in the lobby are hard pressed to speak to you when you come and go... too busy engaged in personal conversations with each other. Too cool to speak to guests... in a hotel... conscious hospitality?\\n\\nThere are maybe 2 team members who actually make the effort to engage with guests.\\n\\nOverall, 11 Howard has been a complete disappointment on my 3rd stay here. After my second stay in December 2016, I was sure that I had found a place to call home in New York City but unfortunately that has been totally and utterly shattered by this experience.\\n\\nThis hotel fails to deliver on so many levels. 11 Howard is cheaper than the other \\'go to\\' hotels around the area... but unfortunately the service matches. \\n\\nI may stay here again, for an ordinary experience if I am in the city for a short time, as I do enjoy the space, but I would not recommend anyone to this hotel who values service.",1,negative

In fact that\\'s an understatement, the noise level kept us awake or woke us early each morning. The windows are double glazed and closed but the noise level is so loud you could convince yourself they are wide open. In addition the hotel is close to Canal subway station which is very convenient but every few minutes you hear rumbling and feel vibrations as a train goes by.\\nTo make things worse the air conditioning in the room was affective in controlling the temperature but sounded like a jet was taking off when the fan started. The walls between the rooms must be paper thin as we heard the tv in the adjacent room and even the alarm ringing on a mobile phone. \\nThe corridors are narrow and dark with numerous rooms leading off them meaning you hear other guests coming and going and the noise of doors slamming shut. \\nThis hotel has a noise issue which no amount of background music is going to cure. I know this city never sleeps but I need to and didn\\'t. \\nOur room was very small best described as tiny and really not big enough to accommodate two people. As a result the double bed is small ,there is also a desk and a chair but nothing else would fit in.  The decor is plain,simple ,somewhat boring and more like a budget hotel rather than a well designed Scandinavian concept. \\nThe room has a small bathroom which is functional but one at a time please as the space is very tight.

We went to the US open by subway and one of the guys on reception helped me plan the trip and printed off copies of the route. \\nNoise is the big problem with this hotel but the staff and service go some way to compensate. \\nI raised my noise complaint with a manager who listened politely and offered compensation.

But this place was different.  It has a special level of sophistication in its sleek lobby and 2nd floor Library.  The SoHo location is straight out of the idyllic version of New York you see in the movies.  Rooms are sparingly decorated without any clutter, hardwood floors are more like an apartment versus a hotel room, and the beds are cushy and ultra-comfortable.  The bathrooms are good-sized for a New York hotel and very well appointed.  The shower has great water pressure and the toiletries all smell and feel fantastic.\\n\\nBut I have to say one of the most significant differences here is the service.  Everyone is so incredibly friendly, but not in an overzealous way that can sometimes be uncomfortable.  More like a friend would treat you - just really caring and warm.

If it was BAD, i don\\'t write a review simply because it will be unfair to negate the efforts of the business owners who set up establishments to take care of their family and employees.\\n\\nBUT in this case, i make an exception and I will give a candid review to bring to light the disrespectful, unprofessional, and pathetic concrete and glass disaster that is 11 Howard, and I will focus on Joseph (-)- The Check-in Receptionist that i had the displeasure of meeting and the Night manager who facilitated Joseph\\'s dishonest and rude behaviour.\\n\\nI arrived New York late at 11:50pm after a 16hour Non Stop flight. Made my way to 11 Howard and the rest has to be the worst 1 hour i ever spent checking into a hotel, and yes, it took 1 hour despite the fact i was the only person checking-in at 12:20AM.\\n\\nJoseph (-) treated me with extreme apathy and disrespect. Expressing all of it in this review only brings back the experience which i wish to forget. He showed no concern for the fact that i was exhausted, struggling to carry my suitcase- My right hand is broken and in a cast, or even offered to help sort out issues with my card to secure the incidentals because the hotel processed credit cards that don\\'t use Chips which is strange because  technology has migrated to cards with chips. So note: if your card has no chip, 11 Howard Hotel\\'s obsolete system cannot process your card. It is too advanced for them.\\n\\nAfter the fiasco, i made it to the room and the climate control wasn\\'t functioning, and there were 2 double beds.

As for the Climate Control, i\\'ll send engineering so go back to your room&quot;. Then he pulled his laptop closer to his face as he sat on his desk and never looked up to my face as i stood there in disbelief. \\n\\nThat was the last straw. So i called Hotwire and expressed my displeasure. The lady from hotwire was very helpful, and she called the hotel to complain on my behalf. After 5 min, she called me back, and told me that Joseph (-) informed her that I, the guest, declined a room with a single bed, and preferred a room with a double bed. He also said the room with a single bed was on a lower floor and that\\'s why I declined the single bed. The audacity of such a blatant LIE is beyond despicable. \\n\\nThere and then, I realised that the bad service, the rudeness, the disrespect, and the LIES from Joe (-) directed at me was all on purpose.

Make sure to drop in for coffee, breakfast, or just relaxing or working. \\n\\nThe downside: Have to deduct one dot for two significant drawbacks, the fitness rooms and the room layout.\\n\\nThere are two workout rooms &quot;Lift&quot; and &quot;Run&quot;, both are very small, have good equipment, but not a lot of it. There is only room for one person to work out comfortably at a time. On both occasions my daughter used the &quot;Lift&quot; room, someone else came in, expressed frustration, and left, putting her in an uncomfortable situation. On the plus side, complimentary day passes to the UFC Gym are available. This was very enjoyable, so do take advantage of that. If an onsite 24/7 fitness room is important to you, you may wish to look elsewhere.\\n\\nRegarding the room layout: With this being our thirteenth visit to NYC, we are not strangers to smaller hotel rooms. Our two double bedded room was the most frustrating room I have been in (though it was very beautiful). Very awkwardly placed furniture made it difficult to be in the room for periods of time. On the plus side, it helped me see what a wonderful space The Library is.\\n\\nPlenty to love here, but for the price, those drawbacks are significant, and they dampened our otherwise wonderful stay.",4,positive

OUT/com/60763/10040329/590918537.html,11 Howard,"""I am the target customer of 11 Howard. I am an early 30-something well-traveled, successful creative director who works primarily in hospitality branding, and who always chooses well-designed hotels. I recently stayed for 3 nights and found more cons than pros at 11 Howard. \\n\\nPros: \\nPrime location. \\n\\nIt\\u2019s a beautifully designed hotel. I\\u2019m a huge appreciator of Danish/Nordic interior and furniture design. I had no issue with the minimalist lobby\\u2014I appreciated it. The materials and finish of rooms are nicely done; lighting design, showers, bathroom fixtures, etc.\\u2014all beautiful. \\n\\nStaff was mostly accommodating and quick. \\n\\nCons: \\nRooms are indeed tight. I booked a King Deluxe and the layout of the room I got looked nothing like the photos\\u2014it was extremely tight (although the bathroom large), the walls were scuffed up in multiple places, and there was very little natural light. I asked to see another King Deluxe and spent the rest of my stay in a larger room with a very tight bathroom on a higher floor. \\n\\nWhile I appreciate the design of the lobby, the staff tends to hang outside the front door of the hotel chatting as there\\u2019s no desk at which to situate themselves. As a result, you often have to go find them outside to ask for a bottled water. (Or was I supposed to go into the drawers and grab it myself? Different staff told me different things.)\\n\\nRoom service delivers every meal in excessive takeout packaging. There is an option to select \\u201cplated\\u201d on the tablet from which you order (the software is buggy, by the way; more on that below), but takeout is the default, and even when I did select plated, it didn\\u2019t arrive that way. Three room service orders over three days, and I had a mound of bags and packaging piling up, which wasn\\u2019t taken by the cleaning service (nor was the neatly arranged lineup of empty water bottles I\\u2019d collected over a few days of staying here; it seems the cleaning service just makes your bed?). Not okay in a tight \\u201cdeluxe\\u201d room; the excessive packaging is certainly not \\u201cconscious\\u201d hospitality. Suggestions: make the room service default \\u201cplated\\u201d; put filled glass filtered-water carafes in every room that can be replaced as needed upon request; make sure cleaning service actually cleans up the room and disposes of garbage and recycling upon each visit. \\n\\nThe software on the tablets is buggy. One morning, I attempted to order breakfast service at 10:50 a.m. (breakfast stops at 11). For reasons unknown, the only menu option that displayed was the late-night menu; by the time I got the breakfast menu to display and attempted to place the order, it was 10:59 a.m. and the checkout screen would only allow for breakfast delivery the following morning. Cool\\u2014I guess the all-day available pre-made A\\u00e7a\\u00ed bowl that comes served in an oversized flat plastic takeout container will suffice. \\n\\nAs other reviews have noted, the gym is very tight here and consists of two small attached former guest rooms on the third floor. It was fine for me\\u2014nobody else was working out while I was there, but had they it would have been awkward; there was no soap in either of the bathrooms (disgusting); they have conical cups for the water dispenser, which means you can\\u2019t reuse your cup; overall equipment is limited. \\n\\nHaving stayed at numerous design-focused hotels in New York within this category, I think 11 Howard has some homework to do. While spaces are indeed beautiful, I don\\u2019t sip the casual, conscious hospitality Kool-aid. 11 Howard is pretty on the outside, but it lacks soul when it comes to the little \\u201cconscious\\u201d details that matter.

Before booking a stay anywhere I like to do my research and also read reviews from previous customers. With that said, I always like to visit a hotel with an open mind and make my own judgement on my stay. At 11 Howard, I was not disappointed. When looking to book my holiday I was extremely keen to find somewhere in Manhattan that offered private outdoor space. Upon looking online I was pleasantly surprised to see that 11 Howard offered just that. I arrived at the hotel after an unfortunate 22 hour travel day to be greeted by some of the most friendly and efficient staff. I loved the concept of being met at the door and checked in via a tablet with minimal fuss but more importantly, treated like a valued guest. Tired and eager to have a good nights rest, I was overjoyed to check into the terrace king room and all that awaited. I immediately opened the French doors to be greeted with a private balcony with breathtaking views of the city. I honestly cannot recommended this room enough to everyone. My room was clean, minimalistic and open and I honestly don\\u2019t have a bad word to say about it. Being a solo traveller, I did have my reservations about being on my own but I have to say that all the staff I met, and I mean all of them are an absolute credit to this hotel. Always friendly, always put me at ease and always available to speak with. It is rare I write such a detailed review but I feel that this hotel deserves that.

The Swedish minimalist pastel aesthetic is essential to a hotel with extremely small rooms (even for NYC).  The room was so small I could hardly move around without banging into things - a large person suffers here - a petite person might not mind as much.  I had only a small suitcase and it was just me but the space was extremely reduced.  The bathroom was almost impossible to use - I was constantly needing to step around to open or close the door in order to get in shower/sit on toilet/brush teeth.  With two people it would have been too much.  No counter space so hair dryer is hung on the back of the door (had to call to find it).  \\n\\nLocation is good but not perfect - a block from the versatile Canal street subway station and it felt a tad shady after dark.

The rooms are good but what sets the hotel apart from others is the staff. Katherine Woods is phenominal and a true asset for the hotel and she really made the stay special for us.

I\\'d be very likely to book with them again, almost guaranteed if it was just based on the experience we had there.\\n\\nNow for the bad. After having paid for our stay months in advance, the hotel by mistake billed us again for the whole stay when we were checking out. Since we stayed there between 1-8th of august it was a hefty charge to have extra on our card while on vacation. It also charged around 1000 dollars on our credit card  as an insurance, which is understandable but this charge should be dropped from the card soon after checkout. After reaching out to them they refunded the extra charge, and also said the insurance they charged would go off the card. That however hasn\\'t happened and its almost 20 days since we checked out. My creditcard company needed a confirmation from 11 Howard to drop that charge manually but once asked for that, they stopped responding to emails about it which I find really unfortunate since this is quite an inconveniance for us.\\n\\nOverall great, recommend the hotel and the great staff but the aftermath has ruined the experience a bit.",4,positive

Starting from the fact that we were allowed to check in about an hour earlier, to the great location (SoHo, Little Italy, Tribeca, Chinatown are more or less are all equidistant), the location that yet feels somewhat discreet, with the entrance on a small quiet Howard St, to the very efficient and friendly staff, to the cool, minimalistic design, all of the above result in a relaxed and hustle-free stay, and make one want to come back again. \\nThe reception desk per se, in its classical sense, is not available. Instead, once in the lobby, head to a big round table, always manned by the hotel\\'s staff. Using a docked tablet, the staff handles your check-in, check-out and answers to all your other questions or needs. \\nTo use one of the three elevators (more than enough), you will have to place your room key card on the black pad, beneath the floor keys. \\nThe WiFi (complimentary) was good, no issues. As with most hotels, you will have to type in your last name and your room number. \\nOur Deluxe King room was of a nice size, and even though it wasn\\'t particularly spacious (248 sq ft), it included a separate sitting area. A 48-inch flat-screen TV didn\\'t, unfortunately, have a built-in Google Chromecast. \\nThe sleep comfort and the soundproofing were both great, even considering that our room was right opposite the elevators. \\nThe USB ports on the night tables are in the docking devices, very useful to charge your cell phones, still having them by your immediate side.  \\nThe room features KEYPR, a convenient technology with in-room tablet for ordering hotel services, in-room dining, etc. A propos, the in-room dining offers several choices, including a few satisfying 24 hrs a day options for the night revellers. The prices are quite budget-friendly for a hotel. \\nThe multiple choices minibar (the locations of which are the fridge inside the closet and the drawers beneath the TV), the roomy closet, the umbrellas in the hotel\\'s lobby, the unlimited free bottles of water, the doormen constantly present and doing their job right  are all great additions contributing to our high ranking of 11 Howard.     \\nThe bathroom is very spacious, with both the sink and the shower featuring golden-tone lavish furnishings. The bathroom toiletries are by Grown Alchemist, one of Australia\\'s biggest skincare exports. Be careful when using the sink, it\\'s designed in an awkward way with lots of unintentional splashing.  \\nThe view to Howard St and part of Lafayette from our 5th floor wasn\\'t &quot;all that&quot;, so make sure you request a room facing Lafayette St, if available. \\nThe 3rd floor fitness center is your typical hotel mini gym, with scarce options, however, showing your hotel key would get you a free guest pass at the nearby UFC Gym, at 277 Canal St, on the corner of Canal and Broadway, about 2 minutes\\' walk; it is a full scale gym with all necessary equipment. \\nThe dining includes The Library (accessible via the spiral staircase to the left of the entrance), which is open for breakfast and also offers all day menu (until 10 PM). We, however, didn\\'t get there and don\\'t have any pertinent information for you, neither have we stopped by The Blond, a lounge and a club accessible via the same spiral staircase. The Blond also features its own entrance on Howard St, thus eliminating too many contacts, if any, with the merrymakers heading to and from. \\nLe Coucou, located on Lafayette St, right around the corner, is a different story. It is a proud recipient of a 2019 Michelin star, and serves excellent French cuisine, perfectly prepared and served. We have been to Le Coucou three times already, and can\\'t recommend the place high enough. Please refer to our dedicated reviews of the establishment.\\n11 Howard had great choices for wellness seekers. Just Ageless is a non-invasive skin care and body contouring studio and HigherDOSE is an infrared spa dedicated to &quot;getting you hot and high&quot;.\\nWe parked at Park-It, an open but attended parking lot at 395 Broome St., 5 minutes\\' walk ($48 for a 24 hrs period); the other option would be City Parking at 40 Mercer St, with the same walking distance of 5 minutes.\\nHighly recommended.

Initially, I thought that someone had been smoking inside the room, but eventually I determined that it was likely a result of smoke constantly drifting up into the room from the street below. We had to keep the windows open to relieve the stuffiness, so there was nothing we could do about the smoke. I also found it odd that there were no screens in the windows. \\n-The bathroom wall is nearly transparent, and the shower door is glass. Could be awkward, depending upon your travel companion! \\n\\nOverall, I would say that for the price we paid I was somewhat disappointed in the experience.

It was clean and functional, by all means, but definitely not something that looked even close to what you expect to get for 240$ in a so called &quot;boutique hotel&quot;. I went down to complain immediately, there was no manager on the premises, &quot; she will be there later&quot; (she never did and I was not the only unhappy guest that day). The house keeping person took me to see the only other available room there, which was on a different floor and looked a bit better, yet had a king size bed. I love the girlfriend I stayed with, but not this way.. I specifically booked a room with 2 twin beds, which was more expensive than the queen size or king size rooms in this hotel. But there was no other availability and the receptionist refused to see my point of not sharing a bed with a friend and lied to my face more than once, trying to claim that they offer to &quot;upgrade&quot; me to the king size bed room, which was cheaper than what I paid, and 5 minutes later, as I was standing there, she offered the same room to a couple who walked in for 180$.. She refused to refund my money and could not offer any discount or compensation (nor sympathy), just kept on talking in chinese with the &quot;manager&quot; and keeping a straight face. As my credit card was already charged, there was nothing else to do, but the whole ordeal was very unpleasant. It took me 2 months before I could review this experience calmly. For 240$ per night I should have stayed in a much better place. So should you.",2,negative

That being said, whoever cleaned our room on the Tuesday did an absolutely amazing job even making us a little cupholder for our toothbrushes!\\n\\nLocation wise this hotel is flawless only a few minutes from the nearest Metro line (2nd avenue, F line) and a short walk from a few others on a different lines (Bleecker Street, Spring Street, Prince St.).  You\\'re also a short walk from a Whole Foods supermarket and there are quite a few restaurants and coffee shops nearby.

From the roof terrace you can see almost every (tall) major landmark in Manhattan and its a great place to relax and listen to the sounds of New York.

However, I have never been treated so rudely by management in a hotel in my life. We chose the Ridge Hotel for the location because it is close to where my daughter lived and we were staying in the city to celebrate her college graduation. The rude deceptive attitude of the manager Steve put a damper on the whole experience  I am not an out of towner, I work in NYC, but we stayed in a hotel so that we could enjoy the experience and all of the graduation festivities and be close to my daughter. I booked a king size room and paid up front through Expedia. The bottom line is that I did not get what I paid for and Steve the manager was quite evasive and sketchy. We paid for a King size room and got a Queen size room without explanation or offer to reimburse us. I think he took $60 off the bill even though he promised an adjustment that never materialized. He neither gave us the room that we paid for or provided any retribution. He avoided me at all costs.  But the worst part of it was that he was always trying to avoid the situation which sealed the deal for me that he did the whole thing on purpose with intent to defraud. I don\\'t care if he responds to this comment and denies that it was intentional, because it very clearly was. There were king size rooms on the floor where we were, but he opted not to change the room or accommodate us in any way whatsoever. We had originally booked two nights in the king size room and paid in full through Expedia. I then decided to book a third night and called the hotel directly. I was told that they weren\\'t sure that they had a king available for the 3rd night but would use best efforts to keep us in the same room for all 3 nights. That is when and why the switcheroo took place. We were put in a Queen size room from the start and told with a smile that they were taking care of us because we could stay in that room for 3 nights without ever telling us that it was a Queen and not what we had paid for or what we were promised. There was no excuse or apology, just a blatant attempt to take advantage of us. The manager would never have said anything to me if I hadn\\'t realized that our room was smaller than anticipated and I questioned it. He clearly was trying to get away with it and I didn\\'t have the time to deal with it because we were so busy during the three days When I attempted to confront him at the front desk, he actually had the audacity to say that he didn\\'t notice me standing right there. Are you kidding? I am a large woman with a commanding presence, you just can\\'t miss me. There are zero amenities at this hotel, for example, we were told that there were muffins in the morning and other snacks and none of those things ever materialized, Why offer something that doesn\\'t exist. The water pitcher in the lobby was perpetually empty. Zero service and zero amenities at this place. \\n\\nThis is the kind of management that gives hotels in NYC a bad name. The deceit, the fraud, the lack of apology and the total lack of courtesy was astonishing. And why am I still so angry about this, not only was I taken advantage of and ignored, but the room was tiny and uncomfortable and that is exactly what I was trying to avoid. The anger and disappointment permeated my stay and I cant believe that this manager Steve did not ever respond or try to do anything to accommodate us. I may be long gone from the nightmare of this hotel stay, but I have not forgotten. There are many other nicer places in the neighborhood. Avoid the Ridge at all costs unless you want to get ripped off. And I can see from other reviews that I do not stand alone and others have also been scammed by this deceitful man. I have been toying with the idea of bringing them to Court and I may still exercise this option",1,negative

OUT/com/60763/1007724/70714472.html,The Ridge Hotel,"""I am not sure about this hotel. We wanted to stay in the Lower East side so our pool of hotels to choose from I guess was limited. We decided to book this hotel for 5 nights based on reviews, the hotel website and location.  We stayed for 2 nights and ended up moving to Hotel Rivington around the corner.\\n\\nI guess the main problem was that we were into the last week of a 3 week trip around Canada and had stayed in some lovely hotels and maybe were quite spoilt. The main issue is the size of the rooms. We booked a room with 2 single beds and I believe these rooms are slightly bigger then the double rooms however they are still really, really small. Also, the rooms are quite dark and lack any real style. I had looked at the hotel website and was aware that the twin rooms had a brown/cream decor but they really are quite dull. I noticed that all rooms on this particular floor were the same regardless of bedding type. I looked at a room with a double bed that was being cleaned and it was similar but even smaller. I assume other floors have rooms with brighter decors per the hotel website. The room was very clean as was the bathroom so if you just want a bed to sleep in and don\\'t care about decor then it is more than adequate. I was not desperate to leave but just knew that The Hotel Rivington was in a similar position, had offered me a slightly cheaper rate, rooms would be bigger and decor more stylish. \\n\\nThe major plus of Hotel East Houston is the location if you are interested in the lower east side and the rooftop. We really enjoyed taking our breakfast up to the rooftop on trays provided and eating in front of the New York skyline. It is also within walking distance of NoLita (loved Elizabeth Street) and Soho etc...\\n\\nWhen we moved to Hotel Rivington, we were a lot happier. The room was almost twice the size, very funky in decor, had a small lounge area with couch and coffee table, a whole wall of wardrobes, automated blinds that you opened from your bed which provided a nice view of the New York skyline, a great bathroom which was grey and silver with double shower and japanese tub and every night there was a turndown service with a different type of sweet example brownies. Although the room rate did not include breakfast like Hotel East Houston, it was $10 cheaper. \\n\\nHotel East Houston was just not right for us.

Starting with the positives, the staff of this hotel was great, helpful, and always friendly.  Caroline at the front desk remembered my name every time I saw her.  She also helped me get into a room for early arrival.  The water bottle in the room (you get to take it with you when you leave) was a great touch, especially with continuous supply of filtered/flavored water in the lobby.  I filled up every time as I was leaving the hotel and every time I got back.  I\\'ve never done a good job of hydrating while business traveling - this trip was a pleasant exception.  The room itself was very nice - spacious with exercise equipment in the room, very comfy bed, and great toiletries in the shower.  Perhaps my favorite service that this hotel offers is complimentary washing of your fitness clothes with SAME DAY return!  Amazing.  The hotel is well situated and is an easy walk to several sites....Grand Central, Theatre District, 5th Ave, museums, etc.  There is a restaurant in the hotel, but no room service...the options looked good (and healthy), but I never ate there as I have too many food favorites in the city.  I\\'ve been to NYC about 12 times over the past year and this is the best hotel I\\'ve stayed in (even better than the famous hotel at 50th and Park that is now closed for renovations...).  That being said, there are a few things I\\'d like them to work on.  The rooms aren\\'t really soundproofed at all.  So bring earplugs.  After being awakened multiple times by people in the hallway and a crying baby next door, I was thankful I had an old pair in my suitcase.  I think it\\'d be neat for the hotel to offer these on the nightstand...sleep is important to wellness so it would fit well with the hotel business model/brand.  This is a small thing, but it took me two days and three asks to get some soap for use at the sink.  This was super strange to me as that seems like a pretty basic expectation.  Finally, it struck me as strange that the hotel doesn\\'t have any recycling bins.  That seemed to go against their brand...I\\'d like to see them make a change on that front.

NYC hotel rooms are normally small and this presents a problem for a &quot;fitness&quot; room. The equipment provided was more than adequate for getting a decent in room work-out, but there was no space to work out in. One needed to be very creative and deliberate in one\\'s movement so as not to hurt oneself or knock out a wall. Seriously, no space whatsoever to do much of anything. Additionally, the layout of the room made it difficult for my husband and I to move around. He would have to step to the side or get on the bed for me to walk around the foot of the bed. There is a desk area with a chair on casters, but hardly enough room to sit because the bed was in the way. The closet door is the bathroom door. Another space saving measure that just didn\\'t work. I was in the bathroom getting ready one morning, and my husband had pulled out one of the bins in the closet area and didn\\'t push it all the way back in when he was done. No big deal, except I couldn\\'t get out of the bathroom. The bin was blocking the sliding door and I was stuck in the bathroom. Luckily he was still in the room. For one person, this room would be fine. Two people.......not so much. It is doable, but not a pleasant experience. We didn\\'t spend much time in the room, so we were happy enough with the accommodations. We slept well and that was what mattered to us. Wouldn\\'t stay here again, though.

The room was in good order with a few quirky touches such as an exercise ball and controllable LED lights around the bed head. We had some trouble in getting the shower to warm up but that could have something to do with the missing screw on the controller. We enjoyed sitting out on the balcony by the bar with a cold Pilsner beer on the two warm evenings that we had whilst we were in NY. The front desk let us down a little on the last day when we had ordered a taxi for the airport but when we checked in the morning it was not in the book so it had to be ordered again. When it did arrive later that day we were told that the driver would come up to reception (which is on the 2nd floor) but the driver stayed in his car so we had no idea that he was there until we asked reception to check the booking again!

Switched room due to electrical issues, yet the new room is still problematic and I got injured. Ended up getting an insignificant 10k IHG points reimbursement (one night at the economy-tier Holiday Inn costs about 40k). I made more calls to the front desk during this stay than the sum of calls I made over one years, and even became familiar with the maintenance guy.I do not believe I just happened to be unlucky, but rather I think it is a clear sign of bad quality.\\n\\nHere\\'s what happened:\\n1. First night, some switches in the room does not shut off corresponding lights, and the remote control for fancy LED lights in the room does not work too (later checkout to be defective according to hotel maintenance). I have to manual unplug power cords for under-bed lights.\\n2. Second day &amp; night, front desk agreed to switch my room. Everything seemed to be functioning, then after I went to bed, LED lights started to randomly light up by itself. At first I thought it is the remote being too sensitive so I remove battery, but problem remains. Again, I have to find and manually unplug power cords.\\n3. On the third day, the door latch was jammed and I got locked in my room. Since it is not possible to fix the door latch from outside, I desperately pushed the latch. I got it to open at the cost of breaking fingernail of my right hand little finger. It hurts. Maintenance fixed on the same day but I was too afraid to lock my room again. Housekeeping did not came until I called twice in late afternoon.\\n\\nOther unpleasant experience include: mediocre gym given how much they branded it, slow elevator, crowded lobby, construction on first floor occasionally blocking entrance.\\n\\nOf course there are still good points about the hotel: other guests are really friendly, the naturistic decoration style, but I don\\'t think it is enough to make up for not meeting baseline of a hotel.",1,negative

EVEN hotel was beyond affordable for the two beds, the location and considering the night of stay. Very affordable!!\\n\\nThe room itself was very nice. It was interesting to see exercise equipment, which I thought was pretty neat. When you turn the tv on, it turns right onto a workout video of a women using the equipment right in the room. I tried to do it, but given the space of the room, it wasn\\'t really all that possible. And a bit inconvenienent as how for a part of the video, you have to use a pole alongside the same wall as the tv.

Our puppy came along with us for her first family trip and she was welcomed with open arms (and a reasonable $50 fee).\\n\\nThe lobby for check-in is on the 2nd floor of the building, so you have to take an elevator up to get to the lobby.

It just makes for an extra elevator trip which kind of wasted some time. My family and I ended up taking the stairs a few times.\\n\\nNote on the elevators - they\\'re fairly small.

While in NYC, we always get enough exercise walking around. The shower was very nice and had relaxing and energizing shampoo and shower gel. The closet/storage space is very small but this is typical in a modern room such as this one. The room did have a Keurig coffee maker with real cream and not powder, which I loved.

It was nice and clean and a different experience than the average hotel. Check in is on the 2nd floor. \\n\\nSide note: there is a corner pizza store at the end of the block that offers 0.99 slices. It was great and perfect for a late night snack. We enjoyed it on the open air lounge that the hotel offers.

I do a lot of travelling for business and a friend highly recommended this place.  I wish I can give it more than 5 stars!  From the moment we checked in, we knew this was a place that considers service a top priority.  From taking our bags to place behind the counter while we checked in, to pouring a refreshing drink of ice coconut water, to ringing the elevator and pushing the button to my floor, and to all of the smiling employees, you can\\'t not feel right at home.  Got to the room and as soon as you enter you realize this isn\\'t your ordinary hotel room - this is your personal gym and spa.  The most important part of staying at a hotel for my wife and I is cleanliness.  It looked and smelled like a team of maids had just left the room with air fresheners and cleaning equipment - it was such a fresh smell and exhilarating to walk into.  The shower was a nice size and to top it all off, the bed/pillows were perfection.  Can\\'t say enough about this place except I hope to see more of them in every city!",5,positive

The rooms are typical size for NYC and love the new fitness concept.  Everything started off well and continued to be a great stay.  As I was pulling up with my car up front to take out my luggage one of the employees Robert was standing outside and helped me unload and bring everything up the Front Desk.  I thought he was a bellmen however he told me he was a manager on property.  I was shocked to see management helping guests carry luggage, very impressed by this.  I stayed for 3 nights on business and the location was amazing.  It was only 2 blocks to Grand Central Station so I was able to use the subway to get down to Lower Manhattan quickly for some dinner.  The lobby bar was nice but I didn\\'t get a chance to eat or drink there.  However staff was very engaging anytime they saw me walk by all saying hello and asking how I was doing.  I saw Robert one more time during my stay randomly in the elevator and he remembered my name asking how everything was going.  He invited me to come stay again in the future and gave me his business card and told me I would be eligible for a welcome back rate and a nice little discount in the future.

Also always best to ask for a higher floor to avoid noise in my opinion.\\nStaff were all polite &amp; friendly. We didn\\'t eat at the hotel as there are loads of great diners for breakfast close by offering better value. Unusually for a hotel the bar also closes at 11pm - again there are other places to have a post theatre or whatever drink near by, but I do think they are missing out on trade here.\\nFew minutes walk to Grand Central makes it a brilliant location for getting about - we bought a week metro pass which was great value &amp; can also be used on the buses too, which we honestly preferred in the heat.\\nOnly minor niggle was our cleaner who seemed to regularly forget to empty bins and/or replenish the coffee. Please put more than one regular coffee capsule in the room please - decaf is revolting.

If it were only the room, I\\'d give it 4 stars. It\\'s perfectly acceptable.\\n\\nWe made the mistake of reserving the room with breakfast, at an additional charge of around $15/pp per day (for 6 days, so we were committed).  The breakfast is \\u00e0 la carte, and you get a voucher for 1 breakfast item and choice of coffee OR juice.  Because it would be unheard of that people might consider it normal to have both for breakfast.  The point is, when you pre-pay breakfast like this there is no savings over the menu itself, and in some cases you\\'re losing money.  So don\\'t do it if you stay here.\\n\\nBut let\\'s get onto that $15 breakfast experience.  Day 1 was bagel with smoked salmon.  20 minutes later, a dwarf bagel with the taste of styrofoam is delivered with two fragments of salmon.  When I was asked how it was, I replied not really good.  I was then lectured by the condescending millennial that portions are small because it is a &quot;wellness&quot; hotel and that the bagel was gluten free to reduce carbs for &quot;wellness&quot; (not nutritionally accurate, but whatever).  They manage to serve the only egg/ham/cheese sandwich that is devoid of taste (for &quot;wellness&quot;).  The granola in the yogurt required diamond-tipped teeth to chew (for &quot;wellness&quot;).  The fritatta was a tasteless, dry disk.\\n\\nOn average it took 5-10 minutes to get a server to take the order and then another 15-20 minutes for the food.  This is because there is one server and one person in the kitchen.  Unless you have 30-40 minutes to burn each day for breakfast, I cannot say this contributed to my wellness.\\n\\nWhen we alerted the front desk to our unhappiness with the small fortune we paid for breakfast and that we\\'d like to not have that option for the rest of our stay, they said that a refund would not be possible.  For the sake of my &quot;wellness&quot;, I will be staying at one of the many more hospitable options in the neighborhood on my next visit.",3,negative

First, it is only six months old as of this review and that means that everything is still shiny new. That\\'s a big plus for EVEN, because hotels in the lower end of the market do not tend to age well. New York is very loud and this hotel is very quiet.

There was no tub and most seniors do not do well with showers. Otherwise the room was comfortable and the bed was perfect. The proximity to the U.N. makes Even Hotel the absolute ideal.

The TV has a few channels dedicated to workout programs that can be done with the equipment in the room. Smart.\\n\\nIf you care nothing about the fitness aspect at all, this is still a *great* choice for other guests like business travelers and tourists.

For business travelers, it\\'s close to midtown to get to their meetings or to travel to points beyond.\\n-\\tThe rooms aren\\u2019t large. This is NYC and space is at a premium.

So, I took an unexpected trip to a floor 15 floors above mine; first world problems \\ud83d\\ude0a.\\n-\\tRandom anecdote (more for IHG than TripAdvisor readers): A hotel maintenance worker got on the elevator with us and greeted everyone and asked how we were doing.

OUT/com/60763/10131859/595086540.html,EVEN Hotel New York - Midtown East,"""The Even is a perfectly nice hotel in a very convenient location. Its style is very European (stark colors, lots of white, angular design), which I suspect is intentional given its proximity to the UN. I had a pleasant stay, but the hotel has some quirks I could do without.\\n\\n1) Elevator system. Reception is on the second floor. If you want to get out of the building, you have to step out on floor 2 and change elevators or walk down the back stairs to the street. Not a big deal, but slightly annoying. Additionally, only 2 elevators serve the entire building (25 floors), which makes progress slow. \\n\\n2) The restaurant is quite small and understaffed. There was only one server for the inside, outside, and bar both times I ate there. This made food ordering slow, and resulted in some awkward standing around with no host to seat you or tell you you could just take a table. There is also no breakfast bar (although you can purchase to-go items at a self-service kiosk). \\n\\nThe next few items pertain to my (single) room, so I don\\u2019t know how much applies to all of them. \\n\\n3) There was no way to completely cover the window, which was both baffling and annoying. The single shade was fixed and only came down three quarters of the way, and the remaining curtain was sheer. While I doubt anyone could see in from across the street, it doesn\\u2019t feel private. \\n\\n4) The room came equipped with exercise equipment (yoga mat, ball, block, and foam roller) and exercise videos on TV. If this appeals to you, all well and good! But if you\\u2019re self conscious about your figure, you can end up feeling a bit...judged? \\nX-D\\n\\n5) The room was quite small, although it made very good use of space. However, it seems ironic to provide exercise equipment in a space where the most one could do is stretch.\\n\\n6) The faucets and shower heads in the bathroom were unreliable and not intuitive to use - at least in terms of switching between them. The drain in my room was also very slow. \\n\\nAll of that said, it\\u2019s still a clean perfectly nice place with friendly staff. Recommend if you\\u2019re not too picky about any of the above.

I had made arrangements through &quot;Hot Wire&quot; and did not feel that I was treated any different than a guest booking through the hotel (this is not always the case with other hotels). We arrived via cab and went straight to the 2nd floor where the lobby is located. There lobby is small, there were three guests ahead of us, however  the two desk attendants Martha and Branka were so delightfully friendly and efficient it took no time for us to check in. Martha assigned us to room #2302 as I shared with her that we were celebrating our 40th wedding Anniversary. The 2nd floor is also the floor where you may purchase food and fill your complementary water bottle with flavored waters. There is also complementary morning newspapers here. The room key is required to use the elevator (you must touch it to the reader in the elevator, then wait for a green light before moving it from the reader) to get to your room.Our room had a King size bed with a very contemporary flair. The bed is so comfortable, and I love that the comforter is nestled with a sheet below and a sheet above it. Sheets and towels are crisp and white and smell so clean. We had a small view of the East River as well as 44th street. There is a new 41 story apartment building going up across the street, which was fun and  interesting to see the progress as it is happening.  We loved the remote controlled sheers and room darkening blinds. Such a cool addition was the colored lights above and below the bed which were also remote controlled and you are able to change the colors. Each side of the bed had a night table with a drawer and a reading light as well as a set of electrical plugs. There are also several other double electrical outlets throughout the room and bathroom. Another wonderful amenity is the mini refrigerator and Keurig coffee maker which is daily restocked with coffee and tea, cups, creamer and sugars. We made use of the closet for our hanging clothing as well as the removable baskets in the lower level of the closet. There is also a small personal safe for guests to use, free of charge. A laptop  will easily fit inside, as well as other things. I had read a head of time about the small closet so I brought a couple of door hangers hooks to use. The closet door is a cool barn style sliding door so you really cannot hang anything on it, however I hung my long dresses just above the drop down desk along with a clear shoe organizer which I stored my additional toiletries.We placed our empty suit cases next to the coffee/mini fridge unit.  (see photos) The bathroom had plenty of lighting and space and we appreciated the shower gel, shampoo and body washes supplied by the hotel.The is a Duane Reed (Walgreen\\'s) store just a one minute walk to the right as you exit the hotel. There is also a outdoor deck on the second floor for guests to use.

The staff were really welcoming, and we had a fantastic room on the 24th floor so we could look out (and over!) much of Manhattan. The lifts were extremely quick, quiet, and reliable, so we hardly noticed how high up we were.\\n\\nThe room was lovely - not the largest I\\'ve stayed in, but perfectly comfortable and at an extremely competitive price, we certainly couldn\\'t complain. The brand obviously pushes \\'wellness\\' which isn\\'t something i\\'m too fussed about, but the Gym looked impressive, and the yoga mat an in-room fitness equipment was a really good idea and added some novelty to the occassion.\\n\\nIt is well located for lots of subway connections and it\\'s very near to Grand Central Terminal so a good base to explore. There\\'s plenty nearby though if you would rather stay \\'above ground\\', and we would recommend (obviously!) Times Square, Bryant Park, the New York Public Library, Grand Central Terminal, the UN, and The Chrysler Building.\\n\\nWe didn\\'t eat at the hotel (though what we saw looked good) as there\\'s so many places nearby for eating - either quick snacks, light breakfasts, or smarter evening meals. We ate one evening at the Patsy\\'s Pizzeria which was only 2-3 minutes walk away, and had breakfast one morning at Ess-a-Bagel (recommended, but go early to beat the queues), and at Pershing Square.\\n\\nAll in all, a fantastic stay, and I will certainly consider staying there next time I\\'m in New York.",5,positive

I did not receive a greeting nor were there any pleasantries, just &quot;checking in?&quot;  Dealing with the front desk at all other times was both ineffectual (requests for more blankets and to have the exercise ball removed from our room were either ignored or required repeated requests) and a chore.

All interactions with the front desk staff involved being treated like they were doing a favor sparing us their time.  The staff person at the bar, who apparently take orders for food over the phone, was completely rude, and at one point told me my order or four items was too big, put the phone down without saying anything then came back and barked at me to tell me what I wanted again.

This is a modern 4-star boutique hotel with a physical wellness theme for visiting travelers. It should be noted that this is a chain of hotels spread across New York. The one I stayed at was literally just outside Midtown Manhattan and within minutes from the famous Grand Central terminal.\\n\\nBesides the convenient location, you\\'ll first notice that the check-in desk at this location is not on ground level, but rather on the 2nd floor. The first floor is essentially a short hallway that leads to a couple of elevators. So theoretically, you could possibly only ever encounter staff at check-in and check-out, which is something I have never experienced in all my years of travelling. Note that if you\\'re driving, there is an indoor 24/7 parking lot right beside the property.\\n\\nCheck-in was smooth, though a bit crowded as the reception desk was really close to the elevators. Be aware that you\\'ll be charged a fee of $100 USD for incidentals on your credit card, which gets reimbursed upon checkout. I was also given a voucher for a complimentary drink of value $15 or less. I was placed on the 17th floor in room 1708.\\n\\nThe second floor lobby itself is not exactly spacious but it\\'s cozy, with many table and seating options and even an outdoor terrace overlooking the street. Books are available to read, as are a variety of [paid] drinks and snacks. There is a bar to claim your free drink, of course.\\n\\nThe room (The King Bed &quot;Wellness&quot; room), while sparse on walking space (Perhaps a bit too small for a family of four), had a modern look and was very pleasing to the eyes. Playing to the theme, there was a variety of exercise equipment available for guest use, including a Swiss ball and some resistance cables. If you turn on the TV, there are several channels of workout routines playing 24/7 for those who might feel the need to work up a sweat in their room. I believe there was a traditional gym area on the property, but I\\'m not 100% sure.\\n\\nThere was even a much appreciated mini-fridge that not only did a good job at keeping things cool, but also was actually empty. This is a good thing as hotels tend to stuff fridges with expensive drinks and snacks, leaving no room for your own food and water.\\n\\nAs awful and wasteful as it is, I like my room cold and was happy with the in-room air conditioning, which actually went pretty low to the 60s. From the bed to the temperature, it was a very comfortable stay. Even the lighting was interesting, with fixtures under the bed and controllable coloured lights behind the bed frame.\\n\\nOther things to note: If it matters, ice machines were not on every floor. The free Wifi worked pretty well in that I could stream video on my devices, although higher quality video did suffer stuttering but it was nothing worth complaining about. The bathroom was clean with plenty of room on the counter-top and a spacious walk-in shower (No tub). An in-room safe was also available.\\n\\nCheck-out was at 11:00 a.m. and was quick and efficient. Keep in mind that you will be charged resort fees in addition to the cost of the room. It\\'s around $26 USD a night, which seems to be the going rate for New York hotels that have these charges.\\n\\nAll in all, I would recommend this hotel and would consider coming back here again. The room, while maybe lacking a bit in walking room, was easy on the eyes and comfortable to boot. It\\'s literally just outside Midtown Manhattan, but short walking distance to Grand Central and 5th Avenue and a few blocks away from Times Square.

Another plus was the larger than normal safe.  \\n\\nAgree with the earlier post regarding the complimentary drinks - no welcome drinks and the complimentary drinks advertised to be up to the value of $15 were in reality a cheap glass of wine of beer.\\n\\nThe reception staff were helpful and friendly (indeed all of the staff in the hotel that we met were extremely polite and friendly).

OUT/com/60763/10131859/668725833.html,EVEN Hotel New York - Midtown East,"""This hotel is really good for its location and is good at providing the bare necessities for a hotel... and that\\u2019s about it. The good points: the bed is quite comfortable and the linen clean, although there was a small tear in the bed sheets, but that didn\\u2019t bother us too much; and the location in mid-town Manhattan is certainly convenient to get around NYC. \\n\\nThe not great points:\\nThe room is TINY. And this was not helped by the room also having exercise equipment that took up more floor space, such as a balance ball and small cushioned stools. This hotel markets itself as a \\u201cgym and wellness\\u201d hotel but there would barely be enough space to do any exercise in the rooms. \\n\\nThe service is ok. Beware that this hotel charges what is called a \\u201cresort fee\\u201d on top of the room rate per night. This resort (or sometimes called \\u201cdestination\\u201d) fee is USD $25 per night (it adds up to almost $30/night after taxes are included). This is apparently common practice in NYC, so probably a good thing to check your accommodation pricing anywhere you stay in NYC. The reason why I say the service is ok, is that there is clearly not enough people at the front desk to check in guests. We waited almost 20 minutes to be checked in (although this was because the an elderly English couple were checking out and was shocked to discover the much higher charges on their room due to the resort fee). \\n\\nThe amenities in the room are also ok-ish. I personally am not a fan of refillable pump bottles for shampoo, conditioner, etc.. although I understand that this is more environmentally friendly as a result of less use of plastic. However, predictably, I ran out of conditioner on the morning of our second day, which is the reason why I don\\u2019t like these refillable pump bottles as housekeeping tends to forget to refill them. I will say though, that upon request, a new refillable pump bottle was provided to our room. But there were no other amenities provided, not even the standard shower cap, although there is a hair dryer. \\n\\nOverall, I consider that the accommodation was priced kind of high considering the service and quality of the rooms.. but I suppose the convenience of the location is the main reason.

I love the concept behind the brand and was very excited to stay here, however I regret to say that my stay was extremely underwhelming. \\n\\nFirstly, when we arrived to the hotel, we discovered that there had been dirty underwear left in our bathroom. I called the front desk and they informed me that all cleaning staff had left and the underwear could not be removed until the following day. To me, this was unacceptable. It is unclear to me how there was not one person in the hotel who could assist with this over the space of 12 hours. Furthermore, this incidence made me question the cleanliness of the room in general and how serious the hotel as a whole takes the cleanliness of rooms. I spoke the Patrick the following day who agreed that this was unacceptable and I found him to be caring and understanding. \\n\\nAfter the above mentioned incident, we were provided with drink vouchers and a late check-out. When we went down last night to use the drink vouchers, we ordered one drink and then later noticed the person working behind the bar was packing up. I found it unusual that she did not ask if we wanted anything else before she did this and as a result, we have not been able to use the remainder of our drink vouchers during our stay. \\n\\nLastly, I called this morning to inquire about our late check-out time as we were never informed. The person that answered the front desk phone told me he couldn\\u2019t help me right now because he was assisting another guest. When I asked for an estimated time (as we were trying to determine whether we needed to pack up our room before departing for breakfast) he said \\u201cwhen I\\u2019m done\\u201d and hung up the phone.

Service in the courtyard was a little slow, but not annoyingly so.  I just think the place has a laid back feel about it, and who wants to rush when you are sitting on a comfy couch in a pretty courtyard drinking good coffee.   We had a very good Sunday brunch meal here. \\n\\nOh, and the spa is worth a visit.  We had a short couples soak in the Japanese tub, which was glorious and I only wish we had booked a longer soak, followed by great massages.

There is a beautiful, brick courtyard with all sorts cool plants in different containers right off the main lobby.  I had lunch out there from the Italian restaurant next door, and it was delicious.  Later in the evening, my husband and I sat in the courtyard and had a cocktail while he smoked a cigar.  The rooms are all different.  The first room they gave us looked out onto Greenwich Street, and since I didn\\'t care for the view, I asked to see another.  They were happy to oblige, and showed me another room (which was an upgrade) that looked onto Franklin St, and I choose that room.  Some of the rooms have soaking tubs, while others only have a shower, which was the case in this room.  However, the shower was awesome, with cool, Moroccan tile and a large &quot;railhead&quot; shower head.  The floors are all wooden, the hallways are darkened, it\\'s very quiet and wonderfully decorated.  I was told most of the paintings in the lobby were painted by Robert De Niro\\'s father.  The hotel used to be a parking lot, and it took 4 years to complete, with over 20 styles of brick used in the construction of the hotel.\\n     Tip: because we used our AMEX platinum card to book our reservation (July \\'11), Greenwich gave us an automatic room upgrade, $25 per person voucher for breakfast, and a $100 voucher for a spa service.  \\n     I booked a spa service for the following morning, which I enjoyed very much.  The spa is in the lowest level and has a nice gym, also.  There are unisex bathrooms/locker rooms each with steam rooms and showers.

The inner courtyard and lounge can only be accessed by hotel guests, and is quite lovely.  The decor of the lobby is a rustic/chic with paintings on the wall by DeNiro\\'s father, reminiscent of Matisse and Modigliani and they are quite good.

The bed was extremely comfortable (a must for my hubbie and I) with high end luxurious bedding, 6 different style pillows to choose from and very very clean and crisp!  A welcome basket full of free yummies that satisfied the health nut and the sugar freak!  Lots and lots of free drinks and bottled water!  High end hair products and face lotions too!  And the homemade cookies that they leave for you are to die for....no really!  We fought over them!  They brought more when we requested more.  The air conditioning was quiet and very adjustable.  Not the floor kind but real air conditioning!  Our room faced the entrance to the street upstairs but was not noisey in the least bit!  We watched as the paparatzzi snapped pictures of the influx of celebrities that happen to be staying in the more elaborate rooms at the Greenwich.  We met Cameron Diaz, Usher and caught a glimpse of the Olson Twins.  We never saw Seal and Heidi and the kids but they were staying there (I overheard the staff talking about it).  The breakfast out in the garden was awesome!  Their frittatta is so delicious I had it two mornings in a row!  Oh yes and the shower was unbelieveable!  My husband loved it!

OUT/com/60763/1028569/121451678.html,Greenwich Hotel,"""We recently enjoyed a weeklong stay at the Greenwich for my wifes\\' birthday.  As many of the reviews have said, this is a relaxing, homely hotel; which feels in some ways more like you\\'re staying with friends rather than in a hotel.  We thought the location was good, and also liked TriBeCa, feeling that the hotel mirrors the area in that it\\'s a more relaxed, easy paced location when compared to other more frenetic areas in the city.  \\n\\nOur \\'Deluxe Greenwich\\' room (405) was comfortable and large enough; and noise wasn\\'t a problem, despite overlooking Greenwich St.  The room had all the amenities we could ask for, and lots of nice little touches, like the bowl of goodies that kept magically getting refilled every evening, and which provided constant temptation for my sweet tooth...\\n\\nThe spa was fantastic.  The underground pool inside the 300 year old Japanese barn immediately transports you to Asia, and was a great place to relax.  My wife had a few treatments too, and loved them.  Plus the gym was very well equipped.\\n\\nThe guest lounge was a favourite of ours, perhaps a bit dark, but it had the feeling of a private members club with none of the formality or pretentiousness.  We ordered from the menu of Locanda Verde (the excellent adjoining restaurant) one night and ate in the lounge, and on other nights we just stopped by for a glass of wine, or a nightcap.  On one occasion there was a lack of seating, but were not surprised as it\\'s popular with guests.\\n\\nThe staff throughout the hotel were friendly and efficient, and we got the impression that no request is too much; although we think we\\'re not very demanding people and so didn\\'t really test this.  They are obviously very well trained and are very friendly if you speak to them, but if you don\\'t then they will almost act as though they\\'re invisible.\\n\\nWe did however have a couple of gripes.  Firstly there didn\\'t seem to be a concierge, so we asked the front desk staff for some local recommendations on a few separate occasions; local restaurants, bars, that type of thing, and their recommendations didn\\'t really come up to scratch.  Sending us to a below average, mostly empty, pizza place one night; and a bar that was closed on another.  We got the impression that maybe they didn\\'t often get asked for this type of advice, and so just said places they were aware of, rather than places they\\'d actually been to.  But that was only a small thing.\\n\\nOur bigger problem was that one evening on returning to the hotel, the atmosphere had changed completely.  The hotel seemed to be on security lockdown.  Instead of the warm welcome we\\'d normally received from the hotel porters; we were immediately challenged as to whether we were guests by someone who worked for the hotel who we had never seen before.  One of the porters recognised us, and we were allowed in.  So we went to the lounge for a nightcap, and on sitting down were again challenged by the same member of staff as to whether we were guests - this was 2 minutes later, so he must have had a very short memory.  Anyway the service in the lounge was very poor that night, we were largely ignored, whilst the staff gathered in groups and shared huddled whispers with each other.  It was clear they were on edge, and when we did eventually grab the attention of the staff to get served and enquired as to what was going on, we were told that they had a \\'distinguished guest\\' in that evening.  We were made to feel that despite being paying guests of the hotel (and lets not forget this is not a cheap hotel), that we were not as important as whoever this \\'distinguished guest\\' was.  What was supposed to be a relaxing drink, was anything but.  So we went to our room, and vowed that should things not be back to a more normal state the following day that we would look to move to a different hotel.   Thankfully the next morning normality had been restored.  \\n\\nWhat we don\\'t understand is that during our stay, we ran into a few instantly recognisable celebrities who were also guests at the hotel, and yet they didn\\'t get different or special treatment from the staff.  So what made that evening so different?  Thankfully none of that really spoiled our stay; I only mention it because we got to see the hotel at its best during our stay, but had we only stayed that one night then I\\'m certain I\\'d be writing an entirely different review.\\n\\nWe will happily go back next time we\\'re in New York.  We just hope there are no \\'distinguished guests\\' there at the same time!",5,positive

OUT/com/60763/1028569/146875310.html,Greenwich Hotel,"""After some indecision over this rating, I am giving this hotel 4 stars, even though it is outstanding in so many ways, because ultimately there are just enough issues that prevent me from conferring that 5th star.  Chief among them,quite simply, is price;  this is by far the most expensive hotel room I have ever taken in NYC - $700 a night before all the taxes - for a room that was smaller than what I get for several hundred dollars less at my usual hotel, and with a bathroom that doesn\\'t compare by any measure.  The bathroom was probably the most disappointing aspect of the room (and we did NOT take the lowest level of room -  we had the Superior Greenwich room). \\n\\nBut we wanted to stay in this part of town for this trip, and the Greenwich certainly seemed to promise the most charismatic and exclusive ambiance from among the choices.  And on that score it definitely delivers - the public spaces are just gorgeous, and when it\\'s cold they keep the fire roaring in the library all day.  We didn\\'t get to use the outdoor patio because of the cold, but in a warmer season, that is going to be a great place to start the day!  And breakfast would definitely be more convenient and comfortable out there, as it is set up with actual tables and chairs.  Instead, we had to take our breakfast in the library where you eat from the low sofa tables, which are perfect for drinks and snacks, but much more difficult and uncomfortable when having to eat with a fork and knife from a plate.  But there is quite possibly no more lovely, inviting spot in New York to relax with a drink - it is beautifully and interestingly decorated, with subdued lighting and deep plush leather sofas that you can really sink into.....and that is precisely what makes it less comfortable, and even awkward, for eating breakfast. And there simply aren\\'t enough spots available for having your breakfast on many mornings, and you\\'ll have to wait for a place to free up.  I think this is a serious issue that this hotel must address somehow. However, while you might wish you could be at a proper dining table while you eat it, you will not be disappointed with the breakfast as it is terrific, whatever you order.  \\n\\nWe found the rooms charmingly eclectic, but not exactly posh, if that is what you like.  They had lots of extras, like plenty of interesting books, and of course all those free treats, which are fun and not your average mini-bar fare.  (And they re-stock what you eat!) Our room on the 5th floor was really quiet, and no city noises intruded at all,even though we had a street-side room (as opposed to courtyard).  It is just altogether a quieter part of town, particularly during the nights.  We liked the hardwood floors, with the throw rugs scattered about, and the furnishings were inviting and comfortable.  The fairly small bathroom - with only a shower and a single sink - in no way can be considered luxury.  We are used to much more opulent bathrooms, particularly at this price point, but in other ways it is up to 5-star standards with plush and plentiful towels, bath robes, slippers, and great toiletries.  The free wifi is something other hotels in the luxury category should be offering, and I commend the Greenwich on this.\\n\\nWe loved staying here, don\\'t get me wrong; the hotel is full of character and incredibly elegant, and it excels at creating a boutique environment.  However, when I think about what I could get for $700 a night elsewhere, I\\'m not sure I would stay here again.  If you can afford the splurge, or can get a better deal than I was able to, you will love the atmosphere of the hotel, and if money is no object, then go for a higher category of room that comes with a soaking tub and more square footage.",4,positive

I asked her why she took my drink order, if the lounge is hotel-guests only.  She could not reply.  Moreover, there was no sign anywhere to indicate such a policy.  I explained I had just been at the spa.

This hotel did more than that, it was like a home away from home. The suite was so spacious and stylish yet it didn\\'t have a hotel feel.

We got the smallest room, but it was amazing - so luxurious but comfortable.  Beautiful wood floors!!!  Immaculate!  Our room overlooked the courtyard - very quiet.  Housekeeping was awesome too!

The bed was was a little uncomfortable, but after hours of trekking around Manhattan, I managed to sleep OK - not a deal breaker.  The food at Locanda Verde was so delicious!  We also ordered room service one night - delicious and about what you would expect to pay for room service.  No biggie.  The one shock at Locanda Verde was that each small glass of diet coke was $5.

Of course, the amenities at The Greenwich Hotel are stellar, beyond what you can imagine.  The snack basket in the room was filled with the most amazing snacks and it was refilled every night.

We chose the Greenwich for several reasons; it was my husband\\u2019s first trip but I\\u2019d been many times, staying, previously, at the Warldorf.  So we wanted to stay somewhere new to us both.  Second, as it was our honeymoon, we wanted somewhere special, well-reviewed, yet intimate.  Also, we wanted a pool; the Greenwich appeared to have it all\\u2026\\n\\nAnd, on the whole, it met many of our expectations.  The downtown location has a great, quirky feeling of community in contrast to the more impersonal mid/uptown areas.  The hotel\\u2019s d\\u00e9cor equally appealed to our taste \\u2013 an elegant, eclectic mix of North Africa / Morocco meets NY loft chic.   The Japanese spa, and the swimming pool particularly, are both superb, and we made as much use of the pool as we could. The internal courtyard dining area is delightful - surrounding diners with lush plants and trees, creating a little oasis of greenery.  Both the bar area, with its log fire, and the lounge are comfortable, and inviting.  The staff are smart, youthful and attractive.  All of these contribute to the impression of a five star, luxury boutique hotel experience.\\n\\nAnd our first day was fab.  On arrival, we were greeted warmly and shown to a pretty, comfortable room with bowls overflowing with sweets and candies, an unnecessarily oversized flatscreen TV, and balcony-style doors with a lovely view of the internal courtyard \\u2013 very tranquil.  \\n\\nHowever, as our stay progressed, we noticed an \\u2018odd\\u2019 deterioration in front of house staff service, the cause of which we couldn\\u2019t quite put our finger on at first.  Then there were a few incidents involving the franchised hotel restaurant, Locanda Verde, and another disappointing one with the hotel bellboy.   After this final incident, my husband had a constructive and positive chat with the duty manager, who listened attentively, agreeing that these incidents were unacceptable and assuring us he would take steps to resolve them.  We unexpectedly received a complementary bottle of champagne in our room shortly afterwards with a very nice note of apology.\\n\\nOn our third day, we went to use the pool as usual only to be told it was \\u201c\\u2026closed for maintenance\\u201d; which may not have been entirely accurate.  It was when we left the hotel that same evening to be completely enveloped by waiting paparazzi that we understood the hotel had welcomed one of its famous guests.  This, we concluded, might be the possible reasons behind the dip in service and sudden pool closure.  We summised that the hotel staff were so in awe of \\u2018celebrity\\u2019 that they had become like \\u2018bunnies in headlights\\u2019 - distracted by their famous client to the cost of other guests; either that, or the hotel has an unofficial policy of employing young, attractive but possibly less experienced staff who simply cannot maintain a consistent level of service.\\n\\nAnd that is the problem; the Greenwich obviously aspires to be a 5 star hotel, and could quite easily be so, but it doesn\\u2019t deliver a consistent, 5 star service \\u2013 that is, unless your Tom Cruise or J-Lo.   As my husband advised the manager, we did not choose the Greenwich because we are impressed by celebrity but that we are impressed by great service, where all guests receive the same high level of service, equally.  That is the difference between a good hotel (the Greenwich) and a great hotel (the Gran Hotel Son Net, Mallorca, owned by a less famous American).  Sadly, in our view \\u2013 because it has a lot to commend it - the Greenwich still has some way to go yet\\u2026",3,negative

But the shower was equally luxurious, with both a regular shower head and a rainwater shower head in a separate shower stall. The room itself was very large by NY standards with a sitting area  that felt separate simply because the room was designed with wood on the alls and ceiling where the small sofa and chairs were while the rest of the room had high ceilings. Each room is decorated differently, but both our rooms had this wood sectioned sitting area that was cosy and nice to sit in. All the items in the mini bar -- Cracker Jack, chocolate chip cookies, and other treats, are complimentary -- you only pay for  liquor and since our rooms looked out on the hotel\\'s beautiful courtyard we never heard any kind of city noise ever. It was quite possibly the quietest night I have ever spent in New York. The doors to all the rooms are made of solid antique oak and are beautiful and also great at keeping out any noise.

And pre-HD TVs that make it incredibly tricky to find actual stations (we could only find pay-per-view channels, despite a fruitless call to the front desk).\\n\\nThis is not to say the hotel is without its charms.

There was a basket full of complimentary chocolate, crisps, pretzels and other snacks as well as a great selection of soft drinks.. everybody of the staff from the cleaner to reception was very attentive and it felt as if they genuinely cared about you.. the location of the hotel is good, walked to many places instead of taking the subway (few subway lines are within a short walking distance). Travelling alone and visiting NYC for the very first time I was a little worried that I might not feel safe enough after dark but after a day or so you can work out the surroundings fairly quickly. Sipping drinks in the hotel\\'s courtyard was a lovely experience, so was the swimming pool and the spa. bumped into couple of celebrities and very important people whilst at the hotel but didn\\'t feel as if I received any different treatment from them... the service was outstanding and more important to me that the facilities at the hotel. Having said that, it would have been nice to have had a bathtub in the room. The soap, shampoo, conditioner etc were from their award winning spa and I bought few of those upon my departure as they were just lovely.",5,positive

It was our Anniversary and there was a beautiful bottle of champagne waiting. The bathroom was really pretty as well as the room. Sheets were top of the line as well as the toiletries. The Spa was a zen like feeling in which you were offered tea or saki. There was a really nice pool. We had a couples massage which was great.The store in the spa had everything you need if you forgot anything with skin products you would want to buy.In the bar downstairs it was i would say old word charm with a eclectic vibe. There were celebrities having drinks and enjoying friends. The restaurant next door which is connected to the hotel is very hard to get a reservation on a weekly basis.

OUT/com/60763/1028569/173647378.html,Greenwich Hotel,"""Planning\\nWe decided about 5 days beforehand to go to NYC. While we are frequent travelers to NYC, we rarely spend any time below E. 60th St, given that both of my sisters live on the Upper East Side. This side, due to my kid\\'s last minute holiday to SC to visit the grandparents, we found ourselves with a spare weekend on our hands. One of the goals was to visit my college buddy, who lives in Brooklyn (which feels as far away as the moon when I\\'m up on the UES with my kids) and to visit parts of Manhattan that we hadn\\'t really spent a ton of time at. My fist inclination was the FS, which I guess is in midtown.  However, my wife decided she would rather be further downtown so we turned our attention to the Greenwich Hotel vs Trump Soho. She decided that the Trump Soho was too large for her tastes, therefore we decided on the Greenwich (plus she liked the neighborhood guide on their website).\\n\\nBooking:\\nThis summer, the Greenwich is running a special via Virtuoso. Upgrade at time of booking if available. The other amenities include $100 spa credit and $25 per person breakfast credit. I was looking at a regular room and the things that I look for are: King bed and separate shower/tub. The Greenwich, however, poses a difficult dilema. The entry level room is the Courtyard, which is queen bed/shower. The next level is Greenwich, which is queen bed/shower/tub followed by superior (king/shower) and deluxe (king/shower/tub in some rooms). The unfortunate nature of the hotels design (and correct me if I\\'m wrong, but it\\'s a fairly new build ie within past 6 years) is that there is no possible way to guarantee a king bed/tub unless one books a suite. Armed with this information, and the only availability being Courtyard, Superior, and Deluxe I opted to book a Superior room with an upgrade to Deluxe at time of booking (note I did ask if I could pay for a Greenwich Room price with upgrade to Superior; however they were not willing to do that). In addition I also asked my travel agent to request a separate shower/tub combination. She noted that she strongly requested such. In addition, I also asked if the spa credit could be substituted with F and B credit, but the hotel noted that the restaurant was separately owned and could not do so. My agent also noted my arrival time (noon) as well as my wife\\'s birthday.\\n\\nArrival/Location:\\nBAL-NYP via Amtrak. Unfortunately, the NE corridor was running behind so we arrived in NYC about 15 minutes behind our scheduled arrival time. Still, we were at the hotel about 1215 after taking the subway line 1 from Penn Station to Franklin St then walking about 5 minutes. Fairly easy access to public transport nearby, with the ACE within a couple blocks as well. The entrance of the hotel is fairly muted and low key and the area itself seems a bit subdued.. However, it\\'s about a 10 minute walk to the hustle and bustle of Soho, while Tribeca itself was close by.\\nOf note, there is currently some construction going on on N. Moore so be wary of that. The check-in area is pretty small and we were helped quickly. Unfortunately our room was not quite ready yet so we dropped our bags off and left our phone number and went to Eataly for lunch (very fun!). Around 2:15 we received a phone call that our room was ready. \\n\\nRe-Arrival:\\nWe were welcomed back; they noted that we had been upgraded from a superior to a deluxe room. After a quick dip of the credit card, two agents escorted us to our room on the third floor. Room 311, facing N.Moore. Noted as a Deluxe room. Unfortunately, only a shower present. I asked the agent about my tub request and she remarked that she had not seen any record of it but she would check again downstairs. She went down and checked; called back apologizing that there was indeed a request but that unfortunately they didn\\'t have any rooms with a tub available at this point. Another call came back about 5 minutes later with an offer to move us to a superior room with a tub the next day. However, after discovering it was a tub/shower combo I declined. Two lovely cookies awaited us.\\n\\nPublic Spaces:\\nThe courtyard was a nice place to read in the morning or have breakfast. They also built a fire in the drawing room which made an excellent and cozy place for a night cap. It was all very intimate and quite nice place to escape the hustle/bustle of NYC.\\n\\nRoom:\\nUnderwhelming I must say. Upon entering a small hall the bathroom is off the the left a lovely refurbished armoire to the right. In the armoire there is a mini bar which is complimentary except for alcohol. Nice selection of beverages including Mexican coke, Perrier, Aranciata San Pelligrino, some juices and some nice looking Ginger ale as well. The mini bar was not restocked at turndown, only in the morning. A fairly nice selection of snacks were offered too including M and Ms, Cape Cod potatoe chips, nuts and some nice looking pretzels. Alcohol prices ranged from the rediculous to the reasonable. $65 for a half bottle of Stoli is ridiculous, but $65 for a half bottle of Hudson Distillery whiskey is actually quite reasonable. No coffee available in room. I couldn\\'t actually ascertain the location of the safe until the last morning when I was checking the drawers; it was disguised as a drawer. Very nice ascetically but I didn\\'t really think to look there. \\n\\nNext with the bathroom. Looking at the floor plans on the website, the bathroom was an exact copy of the Superior room bathroom. I understand that some of the deluxe bathrooms do not have a tub, but I was figuring that the floorplan would be closer to the deluxe bathroom minus a tub; especially the separate toilet. As I\\'ve said, the floorplan was the exact same as the superior room. The toilet behind the door was not ideal and although the website quotes an &quot;oversized&quot; rain shower it seemed closer to a normal sized shower. Probably about 2x4 ft would be my guess, if that. Another minus a small gap at the bottom of the shower door, which allowed a significant amount of water to flow onto the floor. The rain shower was quite nice and very good pressure though. The toiletries were Red Flower I think. Some sort of local NYC brand. Quite nice; 3 ounce bottles were given. Unfortunately, it was only midway through my shower the first night that I realized that they hadn\\'t stocked any conditioner. A gentle reminder the next morning resulted in delivery. The hand soaps are excellent and my wife actually wanted to take them home.I quite liked the Morrocan tile look. Two bathrobes were provided; both the same size. It fit my wife just fine, however, it was quite small on me...\\n\\nThe room itself is reasonably comfortable and quite large by NYC standards. The view was of the construction, though there wasn\\'t any construction throughout the weekend. A pocket door separated it from the hallway and also helped reduce the amount of noise (which actually was not insignificant). The bed was Duxiana, which I guess is Swedish. I was excited to try it because my previous Swedish bed experience (Ikea) was definitely not luxurious. We sleep on a Heavenly bed at home and I felt that the Duxiana bed was springy and soft in comparison. I didn\\'t care for it, but maybe that\\'s just a personal preference. Sheets were Frette and excellent. Our room did not have a couch, but a chair with a table and a lounger type chair. The blackout blinds worked quite well. A large LCD TV was available, but we never turned it on. Free wifi The high ceilings made the room feel quite airy and light. However, the only thing that seemed to separate the deluxe room from the superior room is 50 sq ft...\\n\\nFood and Beverage\\nWell just food. We had breakfast in the courtyard one morning. Their signature Italian soft poached eggs and sausage hash was nice and I quite enjoyed the crispy potatoes. The next day we opted for room service and the food arrived within 20 minutes. The zucchini fritata was quite good, but I was disappointed by the zucchini bread and blueberry polenta muffin. The blueberry doughnut was excellent. It really was. Of note, they don\\'t bring a table for room service and the furniture in the room wasn\\'t optimal for dining. I ended up sitting on an ottoman, which was fine.\\n\\nSpa/Pool\\nThe pool in the basement was very lovely. The beams are either Japanese or Chinese, transported and reassembled. Quite a nice treat to be able to take a dip in the city, especially being without a tub. It was very serene and not a madhouse like I imagine the Trump Soho would be. We were offered a choice of sake or tea, which was a nice touch. There was also a sitting area off to the right, which would have made a lovely place for a hot tub. My wife had a Shiatsu massage which she quite liked but do note that the treatments include a mandatory 20% gratuity so a 60 minute massage is about $250. The workout area looked nice but I did not venture in.\\n\\nService\\nOverall, I would say the service was merely okay, if that. Definitely not as polished the Four Seasons. My wife actually found them a little snotty at first but that evaporated after more interaction. I was quite disappointed that they missed my request for a tub. I could definitely handle not getting a room with a tub because of occupancy issues but to miss the request completely is fairly inexcusable. On negative tripadvisor review, the manager notes that almost anything is available with a quick call including Nespresso machines. I wanted coffee in my room so I asked the front desk if coffee was available in my room and they replied &quot;no unfortunately&quot;. I didn\\'t press the issue, but the GM\\'s reply gives the appearance that they are willing to go the extra mile. In practice however, it seems that that isn\\'t exactly true. They also missed my wife\\'s birthday, which my travel agent had also noted which wasn\\'t a huge deal. We had excellent service in the restaurant and lounge and the pool. Excellent. Housekeeping was okay; new sheets were placed on our bed every day (different trim). However, I had left the wine opener out during the day and the turn down just left it in the same place (askew). Finally, not that it\\'s a big deal but I was never addressed by name except for when I ordered room service where I was addressed as Mr. Firstname, which I thought was strange \\n\\nOverall/Conclusion:\\nPros: nice pool/pool service. good massage. Excellent toiletries. Nice courtyard/drawing room. Good breakfasts. Minibar is nice. Tall ceilings\\nCons: Limited king room selection with bathtub. Poor attention to detail. Missed the little touches. \\n\\nIn conclusion, I would not return. Primarily because in the future I want to guarantee myself a king room with a tub but I can\\'t afford to book a Studio suite.Reading my review, I question if I had unrealistic expectations. Perhaps. This hotel was much more expensive than I had previously budgeted for this trip (room rates higher than both the Trump Soho and the FS) and perhaps my expectations were unrealistic, however, I really feel that they missed/overlooked my requests. I don\\'t want to be a DYKWIA and raise a big fuss but it is important to me. I really did enjoy the pool and the public spaces though. It\\'s quite a nice, cozy intimate hotel and I wish I had had a better experience.",3,negative

I travel to NYC about once every year, and always like to try somewhere new (on the more upscale side).  While I would not give this a five-star review if it were based purely on the grandeur of the property; but, that is exactly why I give TGH my five star rating.  I stayed here in October 2013, and thoroughly enjoyed my one-night stay.  I took full advantage of feeling as though TGH was my home away from home.  It was an experience that, after only 24 hours, I felt completely rejuvenated.  I arrived early and checked out late.  The restaurant, Locanda Verde, is buzzing at night with a great bar area and amazing food/wine list.  The gym and spa/pool area were absolute gems.  My only complaint is that the TV in my room did not have good reception, but the amazing bed more than made up for it.  My most recent hotel stay was at the Mandarin, Las Vegas - and the two hotels do not compare (so, if you are looking for a chi-chi spa type hotel, I would say, this is not the place for you).

Our suite, room 501, was beautiful.  I believe it was a studio suite as there was no separation between bedroom and living area.  It did have a powder room in the entry way in addition to the full bathroom.  The bathroom had a large marble soaking tub that filled up incredibly quickly, a separate marble shower, double sink, water closet with bidet and a beautiful mosaic tile floor.  The bed was comfortable, pillows a bit too soft and the bed headboard, if not antique, looked it- dark wood with inlaid star- really beautiful.  The sitting area had a very cozy leather couch, coffee table and a few chairs with table.  \\n\\nOur plan was to relax and have room service dinner while we watched the Olympics.  The issue was the TV- it would play for 30 minutes and then shut off and could not be turned back on.  It had somehow been set to a sleep timer which we could not turn off so the hotel sent up a tech to fix it.  He fixed it and then within 10 minutes the TV remote alerted us that the batteries were out.  My husband had 2 spare in his bag so we replaced them.  Ordered chicken caesar starter and Mac and cheese entree from room service.   It arrived quickly and was great - a lot of chicken on the starter caesar and the size of the salad was not an appetizer size, definitely main course.  The second time the TV went blank/turned off automatically and wouldn\\'t turn back on, it happened while we were watching the Olympics in bed.  Although we wanted to watch the games we didn\\'t want to deal with someone coming up to our room again so we went to bed.  \\n\\nThe next morning while I was having a bath and husband was watching Olympic curling it cut out again (3rd time), of course during the last few seconds of the event.    The TV did turn on again but it took a few minutes.  We had a late check out and returned to the room after breakfast downstairs to watch more Olympics and that is the 4th time the TV decided to not work.  Again the tech came up to the room but this time we had audio but no picture.  The tech couldn\\'t figure it out so he brought us an extra TV to our room.  \\n\\nWe ordered room service lunch- chicken caesar and vegetable sandwich- it arrived and we failed to check the order before the server left.  We received a chicken-less caesar salad and a bacon grilled cheese sandwich.  I almost picked up the phone to call but we didn\\'t have the time to wait for a new order to be made.  \\n\\nWe love small boutique hotels because of their attention to detail and exemplary service.

The location is great. It took only a few minutes to walk to Soho, and it is just a couple of blocks off the Hudson River. The riverfront park directly west of the hotel is being restored and is completely torn up right now; however, if you go just a block or two south it is a lovely walk for miles.

I loved the thought of this hotel. It\\'s so very NY and quite reflective of my personal style. The Greenwich lived up to expectations but made us feel somewhat uncomfortable. It didn\\'t feel natural for us. Everyone seemed to be trying just that bit too hard to be more effortlessly chic than the next. Maybe that\\'s a reflection of my husband and I, but that\\'s how we felt. When you pay that sort of money for a hotel I think you grow to expect that some things are simply part of the service... We had some fairly pricey surprises come from simple things like ordering a morning coffee or getting some sock and jocks laundered. We also experienced really pretentious service from a young upstart at Locanda Verde. He seemed more interested in attending to tables of single women than topping up our glasses of Barolo! I must finish on a positive note... Our room was cosy but a beautifully assembled mix of pieces clearly curated by someone who knows what they\\'re doing. The spa was also to die for. I had a 2 hour massage and treatment that left me floating. All in all, if you\\'re a beautiful person, or a beautifully wealthy person (better yet - both), you\\'ll love this hotel.

He showed us to our room and went over what was inside. \\n\\nPrior to taking us to the room, Max gave us the option of waiting in the lovely drawing room or even going outside to the courtyard while our room was being given a once over. Mind you, this is all around 1pm. The wait was short, about 20 or so minutes. While we waited we were given complimentary coffee for my wife and a water for myself.

I like my autonomy, as do movie (pop) stars whom also stayed at this hotel which is why I was pleased to see they were not approached by any of the guests for autographs.  It\\'s quite unassuming.  At first you see another warehouse converted into a boutique hotel but things then start to creep up on you, like the service...you can\\'t tell who works there but someone is always around to help.  I ordered the ravioli at the bar one night...the tomato sauce was out of this world, not particularly the flavour but that one could not detect any trace of acidity that most chefs have trouble balancing.  My bed had feather mattresses and down pillows and free food, like Cracker Jacks and Twizzlers and cookies that they replenished daily.

Let me say, it took me 2 weeks of going back in forth deciding if I was going to stay here, or at The Mercer or do what I normally do and stay at The Carlyle Hotel. I am soo glad I picked the Greenwich Hotel it is divine in every way. From the doormen, to check-in, to every service at the hotel,  all the staff are gracious and puts your needs first. The staff wants you to be pleased and certainly has an &quot;I will do this for you&quot; attitude. The hotel has charm, class and an inviting and sophisticated appeal. I felt relaxed as soon as I entered the hotel and was greeted. This hotel is for the sophisticated crowd, who likes luxuries, and privacy. My room was upgraded (through American Express) and there was a complimentary stocked up fridge and also a complimentary basket of goodies....then free wi-fi. My favorite part about the room, was the bathroom. The shower is divine. From the water pressure to the water temperature and the overhead shower head and the other shower head was like being in a spa. Wait...let\\'s now talk about Shibui Spa. Let me first start by saying...I am the pickiest female when it comes to massages. I always get a massage when I travel and I usually complain to my husband that my massages were just okay. When I receive a massage and its not perfect...I\\'m the person that complains to all of my friends not to go there. One reason I felt compelled to right this review is my massage was AMAZING! I had the healing birch massage and I will always remember the massage therapist, Stan, because I will travel back to The Greenwich Hotel just to get a massage from him. All my neck pain and shoulder pain from stress went right out the window. He will make all the pain in your body melt away. I also took a dip in the pool, it was chilly, but it certainly softened my skin. Don\\'t forget to use the sauna/steam shower in the ladies locker room. I usually skip these little luxuries, but I\\'m now dreaming about my 15 minutes of my time I spent relaxing in the sauna. In the morning I woke up late and almost didn\\'t have time to have breakfast. I called the restaurant to see if they could deliver my breakfast to The Drawing Room in 15 minutes. I wasn\\'t surprised when they said &quot;yes&quot;...it seems like I could request anything and they would say &quot;yes&quot;. When I got down to the Drawing Room exactly at 10:30am. out comes the waiter and he had my breakfast on a tray for me in the Drawing Room, but then it was so nice outside, I then requested to sit in the corner in the courtyard, so they made a quick transition for me. The freshly squeezed orange juice and the bacon and eggs were fabulous. I could go on and on about all the other pleasures of The Greenwich Hotel, but you will need to do this for yourself. This is my new luxury hotel when I visit New York. I also want to thank Bailey and Dan at the front desk/concierge, they were beyond helpful in answering my questions before my stay.

It is however dark like most of the hotel common areas. The room needs sprucing up, worn furniture, scratched walls etc. Walking through the hallways no matter what time of day seems like 1:00am. Dark paneling along with yellow lighting and deep red walls is a bit depressing. The drawing room was always extremely crowded so finding a place to have a drink is challenging. The waitstaff  was below par often chatting amongst themselves paying no mind to people waiting for drinks or  attending to tables filled with empty plates and glasses.

We splurged with the couple\\'s soak with 1-hour massages. Oh my goodness. There are no words. The soak rank up there as some of the most romantic experiences of my life. We also had drinks and breakfast in the courtyard which was really nice. Somehow the hotel has created this chic, lush, European-style cafe in the back of its building, exclusive to guests. We really enjoyed the ambiance - some of the best outdoor space I\\'ve seen in the city. \\nThough my one complaint is very minor, it is worth noting.

Probably because that is what was available the first time I stayed there 10 years ago and I never thought of changing or inquiring otherwise.

Recently that hotel was booked and so I took the opportunity to try this much talked about hotel in Tribeca. I should start by saying that I love the city but I cannot stay in Mid-Town; it is too busy. So I much enjoyed staying in Tribeca where I felt a bit removed from the insanity of Times Square when it was time for bed. \\nMy communication with the hotel regarding our (somewhat complicated) reservations were seamless. Joyann Chase,  the reservation manager, was lovely about rearranging reservations and resending confirmations. When I needed to arrange a small dinner party at the hotel, Max, a member of the concierge team, arranged a lovely event in a private space. It was fantastic and he really went above and beyond. The team also secured tough to nab reservations at Dirty French. \\nUpon check-in we were greeted by a lovely team who quickly whisked our bags away. This isn\\'t a top hat team, think more &quot;Chiltern Firehouse,&quot; attired in neat slacks and sweaters. \\nWe were booked in a suite our first two nights and our bathroom was to die for.  A tub, separate shower, and sauna. It was heaven. As mentioned by everyone else there is a basket of free treats (something that should really be standard at any hotel at this price point--but that I have only experienced at Bar Au Lac in Zurich). The bed was comfortable, but the decor set this place apart. It is not standard hotel. There are exposed beams, soft sofas, and lots of wood.  I loved this. It was part of what made me feel like I was coming home every night rather than staying in a hotel.\\nThe &quot;private spaces,&quot; also lent to the homey feel. There is a library reserved for hotel guests where you can have breakfast, tea or cocktails. The library fills up quickly and stays that way most of the day.\\nThe spa was fantastic. I had a great massage and the pool is beautiful and large! This is rare in New York.\\nThe service was spot on. We were seeing a play then leaving straight from the hotel. They had our car pulled up and packed when we returned via car service from the play. Really fantastic.  \\nIn my opinion New York is a city with hundred\\'s of hotels. It is easy to have a great hard product. What sets this hotel apart is that in addition to a great hard product the service is perfect. Really 100%.  I will be back.",5,positive

Rather than apologize and try to set things straight, she took a confrontational pose and made me feel that I made a mistake.  Long story short: she found me a room (same category I booked), but I never felt welcome my 2 nights there.  I had a friend with me who witnessed this exchange, and she was shocked by how it was handled.\\n\\nDespite this sour start, I did like my room and found the public spaces stunning and well worth a visit.  The courtyard patio is a lovely escape.  My husband and I noted and enjoyed the special touches like generous candy and room amenities, internet access, the chalk board by the elevators that provided the weather report, the news rack by the elevator, nicely appointed gym, and beautiful plantings.  We also liked the range of room choices since many NYC hotels have limited choices for those who prefer larger rooms.  The hotel is worth visiting just to see a space that is a new build, but totally of another era.\\n\\nBack to the bad check-in: I\\'d say it points to poor front desk training and mastery of customer service.

I waited to book our hotel room with the app &quot;Hotel Tonight,&quot; because the prices go down as you get closer to check-in time; that is, if rooms in some hotels remain available.  However, I did not end up using the app because I found this  brand new Fairfield Inn online and the price for one night was less than others found on the app, and they honored triple AAA.  The hotel has excellent front desk help and attention to customers\\' needs was excellent.   The Manager, Robert Castano was extremely helpful when we ran into a snag with the parking garage next door.  When we called the hotel for advice and to complain of an expensive error at the parking garage, Robert actually left the hotel and CAME to MEET  us in the garage in order to help us resolve the issue.  (The parking  attendant did not honor the price offered by the hotel and the attendant only spoke Spanish--total frustration)!   Robert\\'s professionalism, and his ability to intervene in Spanish to resolve the problem was magical.  He, and the other staff made our stay feel very special.  In the future, I would stay again, except the hotel bar was lacking atmosphere and space; and the hotel ought to consider changing  the sitting area a bit; and try to rearrange bar into a larger, more inviting area rather than going to a window and ordering as if you were at a bank teller\\'s window ordering something to drinkl.  The person I stayed with said the heating system had  a loud fan which did not allow for a great night\\'s sleep, but I found the black out shade and comfort of the bed very nice. I slept fine and even missed my morning workout because I slept soundly-- and we had to be somewhere. The gym I missed trying out at the hotel has brand new treadmills and elliptical machines with attached televisions.  While we missed the free breakfast, we saw the room that  offers breakfast, which is quite large and offers a buffet, if you are there before 9:30 am  on weekends.",5,positive

My confirmation indicated there was free public parking but did not clearly state it was street parking in front of the hotel.  The bell captain told us that overnight parking was not allowed on the street and sent us to the garage, which we assumed was free.

I did find a much cheaper parking garage at 507 E 70th Street, only one block over.  The rate is $28 a day $36 for SUV even not having a hotel discount.  So I saved $14 a day over the hotel discount at the BMW garage for 5 days there for a total of $70 savings.    \\n\\nOverall this is a great hotel is your are not spending time there due to small room size.

I\\'m also a cost-conscious traveler, so price is important. When booking in NYC, I put price as a priority, since hotels can get extremely pricey. So I found the new Fairfield Inn for about $107 per night, and though I should give it a shot. Two doubles beds are a must, so that was the room we chose. After check-in, we had to drive around the block to the off-site parking garage ($40 for a normal size car), but that\\'s when trouble started. There was a apartment fire that caused hours of delays, street closures, and general mayhem. We couldn\\'t get back to the garage and wandered for the next two hours in search of 1) a way to the garage, or 2) a place to eat and parking nearby. When we finally got close to the hotel/garage, I tried to get out of our reservation. An employee named Daniel insisted on doing what he needed to to keep our business. In fact, he met us at the corner of 57th and 11th and walked alongside our car until we were safely through the police blockade and into the garage (there was a fire engine blocking the street entrance, so he had to direct us onto the sidewalk). After taking care of us, he did it again for another hotel guest. Daniel deserves Employee of the Month. \\n\\nAs for the hotel, there\\'s good an bad: \\n\\nThe good: good complimentary breakfast, contemporary look, friendly staff, and you can park outside the hotel if you check in after 7pm. It\\'s also three blocks from the subway. We went to Rockefeller and it was a three block walk and two stops on the subway to get to our destination. Very easy, even with subway newbies. \\n\\nThe bad: the room was extremely small, even for NYC standards. There was very little room to do anything besides sleep. I\\'m torn about the flooring. There was a laminate surface, which looks nicer than carpet, but I\\'d prefer carpet for my kids. Also, the elevators are excruciatingly slow. They do offer loaner cribs, but it took three attempts to get one to our room. Lastly, our phone wasn\\'t working. The hotel was about two months old, so it\\'s not an issue that I should have to deal with. \\n\\nOur experience was tainted by a fire emergency that was out of the hotel\\'s control, but it still did make our stay a bit of a nightmare.

It was quite close to Columbus Circle and Lincoln Center. (And within walking distance of Central Park BUT not within view of it.) There were some nice local restaurants--including the Greek Kitchen. And it was quiet and away from the madness of Times Square. The hotel is brand new construction. However, the design isn\\'t the best. The check-in area is very narrow and tight, so if several people are checking in, it\\'s difficult to navigate around them and their luggage. \\n\\nMy room was quite small, even by NYC standards. However, I liked the laminate wood (rather than carpet) floor. And overall, the room is well-designed with ample desk space. The bathroom was also small, but there was a shelf to store toiletries. The worst feature of the room was the air vent--it was EXTREMELY noisy (so much so that I turned off the AC and opened the window). There was not a lot of street noise (an occasional ambulance from the nearby Sinai medical center), so the open window arrangement isn\\'t a deal breaker (unless you stay in the summer or are a light sleeper). \\n\\nThe breakfast room was ample size--enough seating (which isn\\'t always the case in hotels with complimentary breakfast). There was a wide variety of food--eggs, sausage, yogurt, fresh fruit, oatmeal with toppings, bagels and pastries, waffles, cold cereal--an excellent value! \\n\\nI have mixed feelings about the front desk staff; they were friendly and cheerful, but not always familiar with the layout of the hotel or the hotel\\'s location (for instance, I was told I was upgraded to a view room, but was actually given a room on the opposite side of the hotel--but I was given an apology and a new room; I asked for some dining recommendations, and the staff member could only give one.

So, finding a good hotel at a reasonable price can be a challenge. The Fairfield Inn offers an excellent balance for for people who want their creature comforts at a price that won\\'t kill the family budget.\\n\\nThe nightly rate of a hotel room in the Big Apple is dependent on several factors:\\n\\n1) Location - This Fairfield Inn is far from midtown and a long walk from Central Park. It\\'s located between 10th &amp; 11th Avenue, closer to the Hudson River than the park.\\n\\n2) Room Size - The rooms, like many Manhattan hotels, are very small...especially compared to suburban or high priced city hotels. I believe the cabin on my last ocean cruise was larger.\\n\\nSo, why am I rating this inn with an Excellent 5 on TripAdvisor?\\n\\nThe reason is that despite these negatives the Fairfield Inn has offsetting benefits that go beyond location and room size.\\n\\n1) Though small, the rooms are perfectly laid out. They are totally efficient. Every switch and outlet is right where it should be. The bathroom is excellent. It\\'s shower is large. The sink and Toto toilet are first rate.  Lighting throughout the room is far better than most hotels I\\'ve stayed at. They even have the most efficient and innovative blackout curtain I\\'ve ever seen on a hotel room window.\\n\\n2) An excellent breakfast is included. It is better than at most Marriott properties we\\'ve been at. Given Manhattan prices that complimentary breakfast could cost you $30 for two people; more if you have kids.\\n\\n3) The staff is super friendly. That\\'s every person from the front desk to the housekeepers. These people actually like their guests.\\n\\n4) The room and facility are spotlessly clean. The entire hotel is modern and well kept up.\\n\\n5) Marriott\\'s point programs can be applied...and Marriott rewards its best customers. So, we were able to apply points to pay for one of our two nights.\\n\\nThe bottom line is that if you can allow for the off-the-beaten-track location and the small room you\\'ll have a nice, efficient hotel room at an affordable price.\\n\\nMy one recommendation to Marriott management is that they consider putting an all-in-one workout machine in their fitness room. These used to be in the fitness rooms years ago but have since disappeared in favor of just hand weights and treadmills.  Though hand weights are OK, an exercise machine would add a lot to my stay.\\n\\nThis Fairfield Inn has my full recommendation.",5,positive

Staff, especially those at the front desk and in the breakfast room, are friendly and helpful. Being a family of 4 with 2 young children, we really appreciated the daily breakfast buffet.

Almost everything under the control of the management works fine. Other stuff such as the ticking of the equipment in the bathroom walls (some kind of water pressure gauge) can be nuisance. The ticking sounds like texting on an iphone few inches away from your ear. Also there is the noise emanating from the street.  If you get to choose, do not pick a room facing the street if you are a light sleeper.  That and on the second morning one of the hotel managers was standing at the top of the stairs by the entrance and shouting loud at some guy he knew on the street @ 6:30 am.\\n\\nThe room is kind of tight and feels cramped even for a couple of people. So make reservation accordingly. It is somehow clean because you get the feeling the floor should have been cleaned better.  We could find hair (long different color than ours) in the corner by the bathroom.  The hotel staff is really friendly. The room has a fridge but not a microwave which can be mitigated by asking the front desk to warm up your food or if wishing to do popcorn.\\n\\nIts location is really good as well. It is 0.2 miles away from the nearest Bus Stop and 0.5 mile from Columbus Circle. Pharmacy and grocery stores are a block or two away to buy water or toothpaste if needed.\\n\\nIt has a decent breakfast. I would surely stay there again.",4,positive
OUT/com/60763/10368723/479281037.html,Fairfield Inn &amp; Suites New York Manhattan/Central Park,"""We stayed a long weekend with another couple (2 rooms).  We found the location good for what we were doing:  partying in Greenwich village, walking in central park, and other touristy things.  The rooms are nice and clean and new.  Mostly its quiet except for the loud slamming of doors and the unnecessarily loud air conditioner.  I was surprised at both because it seems both should be reasonably easy to resolve and it would improve the comfort of stay considerably.  Also, at breakfast time the elevators were really really slow and I think that the usage by cleaning staff contributed to that.  When I was waiting for an elevator (on 8th floor) I noticed that one of the 2 elevators was stopped on the 5th floor for a really long time (like more than 8 minutes).  Anyhow, given the price we paid we were really happy with the place.  There is a little bar in the lobby and a pretty good breakfast downstairs.

Staff members are true hospitality professionals--every single one we interacted with. We were welcomed by name with a big smile at check-in, and greeted each time we passed the front desk. The included breakfast is extensive, and the breakfast staff is most cheerful and helpful; Guillermo in particular made a positive impression on us. Our 1st evening we came downstairs looking for a quick snack and the desk staff microwaved our food, making a point to have each of our snacks ready at the same time so we could eat together. Staff also recommended a wonderful Greek restaurant 1/2 a block up the street where we had an excellent dinner, sitting in a glassed-in area along the sidewalk--great for people-watching. The only downside was the fan which was part of the room temperature control--it was a bit loud for us, even on a low setting.

Everything was perfect and worth a lot more than what we payed for.\\n\\nThe entire hotel was renovated in 2016, which means that the furniture, the decorations, the carpets, the bathrooms, the lobby, the hallways and even more are all in perfect condition.  \\n\\nThe rooms are not super spacious, but hey : this is NYC !  They are still perfectly equiped and totally functional.  Glass showers, modern faucet, beautiful neutral colors, comfortable bedding...

There is always hot coffee and flavored water in the lobby.  Special mention to DANIEL at the front desk who is super friendly and funny, yet still professional and efficient.\\n\\nThe included breakfast was a surprise for us : there was something for every taste.  From scrambled eggs to cereals, oatmeal to sausages, bread, fresh fruits, cake, hard boiled eggs and yogourt, you were garanteed to find something good to sustain you.  This can easily save you 10 to 15$ US every day if you get up early enough to take advantage of it (from 6h30 to 9h on weekdays).\\n\\nBesides the included breakfast, you also have a refrigerator in your room, as well as a safe, without extra fees.  That is not so common in 3 stars hotels in NYC.\\n\\nThe hotel is located on 58th street, between 10th and 11h avenue, a bit set back from the main touristy sites.  But you can get to 59th/Colombus Circle metro station in 5 minutes by foot.  Times Square is at about 10 to 15 minutes by foot also.

Shockingly, their is only very limited space for clothing. There is a wardrobe, about 15 inches wide to hang clothes, that you have to share with the ironing board. Maybe you can hang 5 or 6 things in there. But even more shocking they have no bureau to put your folded clothes!!!. Look at site photos carefully. The room is so small, one can\\'t fit. The TV rests on a long narrow table. You have to pile your clothes on it. In all my trips to NY I have never anything like it. The bathroom is also small.

I suggest go to Madison Square Park and have the best burger in town at Shake Shack and a gelato at Eataly. At the hotel ask for a room facing the Empire State . For the same price you have rooms with different sizes, so remember to ask this when checking in. The studios are comfortable with all appliances you may need. House keeping staff needs to be better managed as they forgot to be present a couple of days.  Do not forget to go to the roof to enjoy the wonderful view and if in the mood do some gym using the brand new apparel they put on it. Breakfast is pretty good including omelets at your choice, but they do not provide a hot milk and so my wife needed to heat it at our room.

We spent a week here for business travel, and we cannot be disappointed more: (1) This hotel only has two elevators, which the hotel house keeping staff share with the guests. This means during sometime of the day only one elevator is working; this can create significant wait time (sometimes 10 min+), and is unacceptable given the Hyatt brand and the price you paid. (2) Superficially friendly staff that do not care about good customer service. The staff are undertrained, impatient and unprofessional. (3) Despite the hotel name includes &quot;Chelsea&quot;, it is not in the nicer area of Chelsea.  The hotel is on 28th St, in the middle of the very noisy flower/hotel subdistrict south of Herald Square. (4) If you are an elite Hyatt member, please be aware that this franchised property does not care about your loyalty to Hyatt (i.e., do not expect any perks as promised by the World of Hyatt program).  Overall, I find that Hyatt House NY/Chelsea is one of those bottom performers among Hyatt properties; it only has the name of a Hyatt but not the good service you would expect from a Hyatt. Everything I experienced at this property points to a short-sighted developer/management who only cares about immediate bottom-line. For the same price, there are plenty of other better Hyatt locations you can choose from in NYC; so please avoid this hotel at all costs!",2,negative

We chose it knowing that it was very new and well-located within Manhattan.  Having lived in NYC, we wanted a hotel where we could use as a home base as we explored, but not have to bee too dependent on taxis and Ubers.\\n\\nWe were very pleased with the choice.  The hotel was very modern, and had all the bells and whistles (in-house breakfast included, phenomenal rooftop fitness center and patio with 30 story views of the Empire State building and midtown manhattan).\\n\\nOur room had a great studio kitchen with dishwasher, small fridge and range-top so had we wanted to actually cook, we could have.  It also had an island which doubled as a communal table/workspace.  We had a double queen room which was ample sized for the 4 of us.  USB ports were in abundance so it was easy to keep devices charged.  Wifi was free and we had a 50in UHD TV with built-in channel guide. \\n\\nBreakfast was full-service - hot food (omelettes, scrambled eggs, hash browns, bacon) along with fresh fruit, yogurt, assorted cereals and toast/english muffins).  Several juice and coffee options.  The kids ate well and we didn\\'t have to shell out for separate breakfast.\\n\\nLocation was what we hoped for as it was an easy walk to Times Square, Central Park, Rockefeller Center and Union Square.  There was a convenient access point on 28th street onto the High-line for the trendier set and joggers.  The hotel is in Chelsea, so lots of great shopping and not too far to get to Chelsea Market and the meatpacking district for high-end boutiques.  The 7th Avenue line (1 train) was less than a block away which made getting around mega-convenient.\\n\\nOne word of advice, if you are staying during a peak holiday, choose a low floor (10 or less).  The breakfast and Bar is on the 2nd floor, so you can take the stairs and avoid waiting for elevators (there are 2 for the building and waits can run on the longer side, but not too bad).\\n\\nThe staff was very attentive and made the stay really easy for the entire family.

I\\'m sure glad I did--this is an excellent hotel and I\\'ll definitely be back!\\n\\nLike other Hyatt House properties, the rooms in this place have full kitchen facilities (full refrigerator, two-burner stove, microwave, dishwasher, sink, plates/glasses/cookware, etc.) and a small dining area, in addition to the bedroom and bathroom. This makes it great for long-term stays (which is the sort of traveler that this hotel seems to be aiming for), but it\\'s also convenient for short stays as well.  The rooms are ample size, and nicely equipped and furnished.\\n\\nHotels in Manhattan--especially ones on the busier streets like this one (6th Avenue), tend to be very noisy because of the constant midtown street noises, but I was pleasantly surprised at how quiet the rooms are here--especially given that my room was on a fairly low floor (the 9th) rather than on one the higher floors farther away from the street (this hotel has 30 floors). They must use really thick, noise-resistant glass in the windows to prevent the constant outdoor noise from coming into the rooms. Also, because the hotel is tall with a small footprint, most of the other rooms are a distance away from your room on other floors (our floor had only 9 rooms on it), so there is less of a chance of adjacent room noise. We really heard no noise at all from other rooms in the hotel.\\n\\nThe staff was incredibly accommodating and friendly. All of them really went out of their way to make the stay comfortable and easy. For example, I arrived on a red-eye and got to the hotel at about 9:30 a.m. hoping just to drop of my bags and come back later in the afternoon when a room might be available, but the staff went out of its way to put me in a room by as early as about 10:00 a.m., hours before the scheduled check-in time! Staff also helped us find some property we misplaced in the hotel, arranged airport transportation, and did any number of other things to make the stay a good one.\\n\\nThe hotel has a nice modern workout room on the roof, with an outdoor patio (the latter not really being usable for us in the sub-freezing weather we had, unfortunately), all of it with a beautiful view with the Empire State Building on the far left all the way to the Hudson River on the far right. As with other Hyatt House properties, the room price includes a full breakfast with an omelet bar and many other selections.\\n\\nAll of this was for a price that was amazingly low by Manhattan hotel standards. I\\'ve often paid more far than twice the price I paid here at other area hotels, and not been as happy as I was with this hotel. It\\'s true that this was undoubtedly not peak season and prices were lower than they would likely be at other times of the year, the price I paid was still significantly lower than the price other comparable hotels were charging that same week.\\n\\nAnyway, this is an excellent new hotel and there\\'s not doubt I\\'ll be back!",5,positive

I had two concerns which I wanted to bring to the hotels attention. First the AC climate control is confusing and poorly maintained, resulting in a very uncomfortable first night of our stay.  To explain there are actually two thermostats  --- one on the outside window wall and one on an inner wall.  I didn\\'t realize that when we got in the first evening (and there was no written indication) so I set things incorrectly and I believe the two systems were fighting with each other making for a poor quite uncomfortable first night.  Several calls and visits to the room resulted in several different &quot;recommendations&quot; the most frustrating being &quot;don\\'t touch the window thermostats&quot;, unfortunately too late since I had already set it before realizing the next morning there was a second thermostat.  Finally a knowledgable tech came up, told me to leave the window thermostat off and just use the inside one.  When I complained about the noisiness of the system he opened it up and realized the replaceable AC filter was extremely dirty and had been installed last August.  Thankfully he got a new one and put it in  -- but where were the room inspectors on this -- we had been told everyone room was inspected prior to being released for the incoming guests.  The second, minor, problem was the lack of a second chair.  There were a few hours one night when we both wanted to sit in this two person room  !

First, on Oct. 1 at 3 am a fire alarm went off that last nearly a half hour.  The hotel staff seemed very unprepared for this and we were not sure if we should leave the room or not.  After about a half hour and several announcements the alarm was turned off.  Needless to say this was very unnerving and the hotel staff did little to ease our concerns.  If that were not bad enough I got a wake up call at 5 am that same morning.  It was not meant for my room. So, I got almost no sleep that night.  To the credit of the hotel they credited me that night but only after I insisted. It was not offered to me and there seemed to be little concern about my experience.  The room is fine with a nice view, good bed, kitchenette and a nice enough bathroom.  The air conditioning had to be worked on three separate times.  A repair person was sent up to the room each time (after long waits) and he did &quot;a hard reset&quot; each time that fixed the problem.  But it kept happening.  Very annoying.  Then just to make matters worse the cable TV went out int the middle of the MLB playoffs.  I was told that this was because of a storm.  I find it hard to believe that a minor storm would knock out the entire cable TV system to the hotel. This should not happen.  So, it is hard for me to recommend this hotel based on my recent experiences there.  I think that the hotel has a lot of potential as it is well located and the rooms are nicely appointed.  But the service really keeps me from recommending the hotel.  Also, if you are expecting a nice lobby to sit in this is not a hotel for you.  There is only a desk and a bench and the elevator bank.  No lobby to meet people in or to lounge in.  Very bare bones for a Hyatt.

If they are in the high end the price is right (maybe even too low), but the quality of the amenities need to improve. E.g. the coffee in the breakfast room is just black coffee, you cannot chose a cappuccino or alike. And the towels in the room are really horrible.

My personal advice is that if you flew in to NYC (via LaGuardia) you can get a week train pass from the Hudson News Stand for like $29 dollars.  It is located by baggage claim. GET THIS! YOU WILL GET YOUR MONEYS WORTH....even if your stay 3 or 4 days, at $2.25 each way it adds up fast.  Anyway, the F train is a 5 min walk.

There is a Starbucks about a 15 min walk at Allen and Delancey.  If your worried about the walk then you better get used to it, that seems to be all that you do in NYC.

It is actually on the edge of Chinatown and a pretty bad neighborhood, which I work in every day.  I don\\'t even think it has a name.  Some call it part of Chinatown, some call it the Lower East Side (it would have to be the lower lower lower east side, in my opinion).  My coworkers and I call it the Armpit of Manhattan.  Surprisingly, there are no good Chinese restaurants in this area.  You will have to walk northeast into the trendy Lower East Side or northwest into Chinatown for good food/drinks.  If you come back to this hotel late at night, take a cab.  This neighborhood may be labeled &quot;up and coming&quot;, but it still has a ways to go.

Originally we were going to stay in Jersey and suffer the commute because of cost. We were not disappointed by Hotel 91 and our expectations were exceeded. \\nSTAFF: The staff was excelptional and quite helpful. We had to change our reservation dates 3 different times and Hotel 91 kept track of it all. We also weren\\'t charged for the changes since they were made more than 24 hours in advance. \\nGETTING THERE: Per TripAdvisor reviews, we knew some people had trouble with their cabs getting to Hotel 91 so we printed out detailed directions from LGA. We needed 2 cabs; 1 driver knew where the hotel was and 1 did not. But between the directions from the hotel website and our GPS Map App on our phone, the 2nd cab arrived without issue. We arrived at midnight, but there is someone at the desk 24 hrs a day (2nd floor check in-remember that!). \\nLOCATION: The hotel is 2 blocks from the East Broadway Subway stop (F line), which goes directly to Rockefeller Center and connects to all the other lines (of course). Every breakfast we went to a restaurant called \\'Everest\\' [head out of the hotel to the left is about 5 blocks down on the left]. EXCELLENT food. You are in the middle of Chinatown, which is very authentic. There is an \\'American\\' grocery store straight down Eldridge about 1 block which had bottled water and common sodas. Be sure to notice the grade the Sanitation Dept gives to each restaurant in the area (you\\'ll see a big blue A, B, C, etc). Little Italy is not far either, and we had pizza delivered from Lombardi\\'s (the FIRST pizzaria) twice. Having been to New York 3 times before, the family appreciated staying in a neighborhood that wasn\\'t as tourist-y as others.\\nOVERALL: Keep in mind, this is a basic hotel but it is FREE of bed bugs (a priority for us), the staff is great and helpful, and it\\'s on Manhattan island for an unbeatable price. The carpeting is a little dated as are some lighting fixtures, etc, but there bedding was the modern style, there was a flat screen TV in the room and a hairdryer (coffee is in the 2nd floor lobby, 24 hrs a day).

There were three of us so had the double queen room.\\n\\nThe room was very spacious as was the bathroom. It was basic, though had a TV, one bedside table, two desks, a chair, full size ironing board and iron. The one criticism was that there wasn\\'t a lot of hanging space for clothes.\\n\\nThe beds were clean and comfy. The beds were made every day with fresh towels for the bathroom. Overall we were impressed with the hotel room and is facilities. For the price we paid and for being in New York at that time of year was a bargain. I went in 2011 and stayed in someone\\'s basement in Jersey!\\n\\nThe location is extremely handy for Downtown attractions like Wall Street, 9/11 Memorial, ferry to Statue of Liberty (about a 10-15 minute walk) but is quite a way from Time Square, Central Park etc. You can walk it, but expect it to take over an hour. Cab fares range between $15-$20 one way excluding tip - cheap if split three ways, not so much if you\\'re on your own.\\n\\nIt\\'ll be wrong not to mention that the train goes past the hotel fairly frequently. We were at the front of the hotel so good the most noise, but they have tried to limit it by installing secondary glazing. To me it sounds like the window blowing against the window. Roughly they pass every 15-20 minutes, less the latest it gets. It was obvious, but not as much to stop me from sleeping.\\n\\nWe like Chinatown so enjoyed going shopping and eating out in the evenings in the area. It\\'s very close to Little Italy too, so get a good pizza before you leave!\\n\\nIn summary, we were really pleased for the price. We never had to deal with the staff, so can\\'t comment, but they looked after our bags all day on our last day for free. I would stay here again",4,positive

Having never been to New York before, we needed alot of help and they did everything they could for us, giving us tips about the city, restuarants and the dreadful subway.   They even provided us with maps of the city. Our room was on the side of the train and we heard it but it never kept us up. The rooms were clean and pleasant, with plenty of room, Wifi and TV.

OUT/com/60763/1048678/18890042.html,The Hotel 91,"""The hotel is in a weird part of town, not particularly central to any part of the city but a great cultural experience in one of New York\\'s oldest neighborhoods nonetheless.\\n\\nThe decor is a bit drab, when you first walk in you see a bunch of glass stalls, which upon further investigation are supposed to be stores.  (How you\\'re supposed to have a store in a 5 foot by 10 foot space I have no idea)  The 2nd floor is where the front desk is, which was fine, the staff was pretty efficient and very warm and personable, unlike a lot of Manhattan hotels.  They were helpful throughout the entire stay.  The lounge area on the second floor is terribly decorated.  It looks like someone took all of their grandmother\\'s junk from the last 40 years and threw it in one room.  There is a flatscreen tv, but it\\'s surrounded by 3 junky old leather couches (the hotel is supposedly new, would it have been too much to spend $2000 to put 3 new couches in?  After all, it\\'s the first thing people see when they walk in.).  Then there is a big white porcelain elephant and what looks like an urn just sitting on the floor next to the couch.  Doesn\\'t go with the couches, the TV or the rickety old chinese furniture in the room.  The carpet in the lobby areas throughout the hotel is just horrid looking, it makes you dizzy just walking on it, it looks kind of like the carpet from &quot;The Shining&quot;.\\n\\nThe rooms themselves have just about everything you really need for a hotel stay: TV, internet, comfortable bed, private bathroom.  The decor is pretty shabby, cheap vinyl chairs and furniture that looks like it was made by a boy scout at camp.  Cheap plastic covered wood.  The bathroom marble counter doesn\\'t match the tiles on the floor or the wall.  Looks like someone went to a lot of hardware clearance sales.\\n\\nFor its price, the hotel is actually a good value and I\\'m being overly picky about the decorator\\'s terribly bad taste.  But whichever interior decorator did the hotel should definitely reconsider their career.\\n\\nThe only real gripes I have are:\\n\\nA. Cleanliness - A lot of other reviewers have said this hotel is clean.  I would agree, at first glance.  But a closer look would reveal a lot of corner cutting.  The middle of the room gets vacuumed but there is dirt at the edges.  The windows never get cleaned and are outright filthy.  Stains and smudges on the walls.  Garbage in the hallways, stairwells and elevators.  It\\'s obvious that their housekeepers are understaffed and overworked, so it\\'s understandable they can\\'t get to everything.  But it doesn\\'t excuse the fact that things aren\\'t clean.\\n\\nB. Someone else had mentioned a nosy owner during their stay, and I would agree.  During my check in, a similar old lady came out of the elevator, walked around the line (3-4 people waiting to check in at this point) to the side of the counter and started demanding things from the kid working the counter (who was obviously already speaking with a customer).  &quot;Print this, is so and so here, I need this and that.&quot; in a very loud and obnoxious manner.  Very unprofessional in a hotel environment and obviously could have waited until after guests had finished.  After she had gotten her list of demands, the kid said &quot;Sorry for the inconvenience, but that was the owner&quot;.\\n\\nThe next day, the owner happened to be on the elevator when I got on and tried to make small talk.  It turned into a grilling about what I was doing on my trip to New York and then an endless list of things I SHOULD do according to her.  If I needed the advice I would have asked.\\n\\nObviously this is the owner\\'s first hotel and she has no experience whatsoever with hospitality.  She would be well advised to take after her employees a bit, who actually made an otherwise very average stay pretty pleasant.  For the price, the hotel is a good place to stay.  Just avoid the owner and pretend you\\'re colorblind when you look at the decor.",3,negative

This time, I decided to try Hotel 91 to see if I might want to add it to the roster. Sadly, I will not be coming back.\\n\\nIf there is one great review I can give it, it\\'s the very friendly staff. Close on their heels are the beds - I had a great night\\'s sleep. (Of course, one person\\'s great bed is another\\'s backache.) They have free wireless that\\'s supposedly in the lobby, but I had no problem getting it in my room. Where this hotel fell short was on location and maintenance. \\n\\nUnless you are willing to walk a long way, particularly in a New York winter, there is only one nearby line (F). It\\'s not a bad one, but it\\'s not always a quick jaunt to a connection with more options. There aren\\'t a lot of good food choices in the immediate vicinity, either, particularly late-night. But the worst thing about this hotel, the deal killer for me, is the stench. Whether you\\'re in the elevator or in a room, you\\'re in a constant nose-curdling stink like someone dumped a bottle of cheap men\\'s cologne on the rug to cover other smells. Those other smells are the usual musty sort you get in older New York hotels - mildly unpleasant, but not stinky like whatever they\\'re using to try to cover it up. I also had a lot of trouble with the electrical plugs in the room, half of which didn\\'t work.\\n\\nBy the way, you may see photos of the rooms or lobby on some travel sites. They are not accurate to what you\\'re getting. The rooms are quite small and (except for the beds) much dimmer and more run down. I would not call the lobby welcoming.\\n\\nIt\\'s probably a much nicer hotel in the summer, when you can open the window to air a room out and it\\'s no big deal to walk to another neighborhood or subway line.

OUT/com/60763/1048678/19314823.html,The Hotel 91,"""What a great find!  I needed a place to stay on the Lower East Side for a class I was taking.  After reading various reviews, I decided to take a chance on Hotel 91.  My roommate and I had a wonderful experience.  The hotel was clean, sparkling bathrooms, crisp white comforters and very plush beds.  Having stayed at hotels in NYC, including The Plaza, I was hesitant, but I needn\\'t have been.  The hotel staff was friendly and helpful and the noise was nothing like some of the reviews said.  Yes, the hotel is near the Manhattan Bridge, but the windows are double pane with an air layer in between.  Any sounds we heard were much quieter than most hotel air-conditioners.  And the air-conditioner in the room here was extremely quiet and worked well.  We requested a room that overlooked the street and also one that was large since we were going to be there for five nights.  We got a handicapped accessible room that was quite ample for the two of us - 2 queen size beds.  The outer hallway was huge; there was even  another bathroom directly across from our room.  The decor is spartan; nothing on the walls, an armoire for a closet, no ironing board or iron, but there was a flat HDTV and it worked for us.  It doesn\\'t have amenities like a restaurant or swimming pool but for our needs, it was just fine.  We even got a discount because we stayed there for more than 4 nights.  The flavor of Chinatown was really an added plus.  We could walk to Little Italy and experience all the sights and sounds of the area.

OUT/com/60763/1048678/193178693.html,The Hotel 91,"""I chose the Hotel 91 in New York\\'s Chinatown for 2 main reasons; 1) it would be fun to stay in Chinatown, and 2) the nightly price was very nice.  On either side of the entry are Chinese food stall style stores selling everything from fruits and vegetables to things that shouldn\\'t be for human consumption.  And knowing how filthy and foul-smelling Chinatown can be, I expected the worst from the Hotel 91.  Upon opening the entry doors, you kind of step into a different world than the one you left on the sidewalk.  Bright lights, new tiling, new paint...cleanliness!  The lobby is actually on the 2nd floor.  Check-in was super fast and the hostess was very friendly.  Going up to my room on the 5th floor took a little while because the elevators are very slow.  Upon opening the room door, I was very pleasantly surprised by how clean and put together the room was.  The bathroom was recently renovated entirely in floor to ceiling tile, a new vanity, gleaming white tub with a curtain that was clean and does not get drawn in on you when taking a shower.  The room is somewhat small, but this is New York.  The bed was very comfortable.  Free WiFi internet is available as is wired internet in each room.  My view was of the Manhattan Bridge, which was so close, it seemed like you could touch it.  There are several subway lines that run along the Manhattan Bridge 24 hours a day (it slows down noticeably after 9PM.)  Being a New Yorker, the noise and the rumble didn\\'t bother me.  In fact, it brought back memories of the B train on 86th street and how it would make the entire block rumble when it went by.  Those not used to this type of noise may find it difficult to sleep.  However, the window had 2 panes of thick glass with an 18 inch airspace plus a noise reducing drape to help absorb a lot of the noise and rumble.  The subway (F line) is about 4 blocks away.  You are within walking distance of Mott Street (the traditional hub of Chinatown), Little Italy, and Soho.  There are plenty of restaurants in the vicinity.  The problem is that most DO NOT speak English.  I found a wonderful restaurant 2 blocks away (Yung Sun) but couldn\\'t pre-order my pick-up because nobody there spoke a word of English.  This is a wonderful, wonderful hotel that has everything I look for in a hotel; clean bed, clean bathroom, nice linens, good location, friendly staff, and a competitive price.",4,positive

I frequently take the chinatown express bus from Washington, DC to Manhattan\\'s chinatown and walked by the hotel on my way from the bus stop to the subway.  My friends and I got the room at $219.00 per night, which I thought was a great deal considering the last 2 weeks of August are the height of the summer tourist season.  \\n\\nI actually had to work in Flushing, so I asked the concierge about how to get there.  He told me that I could take the chinese shuttle to Flushing for $2.50, it departs from Confucius Plaza when the bus is full.  Shweet!\\n\\nWe had a room on the other side of the hotel so we did not hear the trains at night.  The room was small, we had 2 queen beds, but all you really need is a clean bed and shower and we were very satisfied with that.  The beds and bathrooms were comparable to an upscale 3 star hotel.  I loved the modern decor combined with Asian accents.\\n\\nService was excellent, the people at the front desk were very helpful.  While there were no ironing boards and irons in the room, when I asked to borrow them, the gal brought them to my room within the hour.\\n\\nIn the morning you can walk to any of the bakeries and get a pastry and coffee for less than $2.00.  I also got Bubble tea in the afternoons.\\n\\nOne morning, I walked a few blocks and hopped on the F train at the corner and took it to Koreatown at 32nd and Broadway, very quick ride and only costs $2.00 one way.\\n\\nThe hotel is still new and the ground floor glass retail shops are still vacant.  It\\'s sort of odd to walk by the empty rooms on the way to the elevator.  I wonder about security.  I see the black half dome security cameras in the ceilings but you don\\'t need your hotel room key to go access the elevator at all.  So that means that anyone walking off the street can get in the elevator and walk the halls of the hotel on any floor.  I never had a problem during my stay regarding security, but I do wonder about it.\\n\\nWe also walked around, there is so much to see and do, the Buddhist temples, all the shops and restaurants, Little Italy, men playing chinese checkers in Columbus Park, people doing Tai Chi outdoors in the mornings, etc.  I loved it.

Entering Hotel 91 is not the most inviting experience. You travel down a long hallway with no adjoining retail or hotel services (just an empty hallway). You take an elevator to the second floor where the checkin desk is. Also, on the second floor is a rather drab &quot;lounge&quot; that appears to have been decorated with whatever furniture the local Good Will had available. The crowd is also mostly European (not to knock Europeans, but this also made me feel like I was in a hostel).\\n\\nOn the plus side, the rooms were clean and the bed comfortable - but don\\'t expect any frills. The rooms don\\'t even have closets. The maid service was also good. The people at the main desk were also very nice, friendly and helpful. Hotel 91 is also close to subway stations and not far from some fun restaurants, bars and galleries on nearby Orchard Street.\\n\\nOn the negative side, raised train tracks run right next to the hotel. You hear the sounds of commuter trains all day and all night. I sort of got used to the sound -- sort of like a jet plane taking off or a really strong wind gust -- but buyer beware.\\n\\nOne negative experience during my trip was that my original room did not have hot water starting on the 3rd day of my 4 night visit. Signs around the hotel indicated that the city shut off the water from 12am to 4am, but as of late afternoon 12 hours later, my room still did not have hot water. I called the front desk and they said my floor was having problems with hot water. They offered to let me shower in another room. I asked to switch rooms, which they accommodated very nicely. \\n\\nAll in all, not a bad deal by NYC standards, although I think the roughly $200/night I paid was a bit high for what I got.",3,negative

I feel much the same as many, if you are looking for a five star experience then look near times square and the five star price tag. This is a no frills hotel that gives you a clean room to sleep in and a close stop to the subway. And on the note of the subway, we stayed on the track side of the hotel and there was track noise every 5-7 minutes or so, but neither one of thought it was really that loud. If you are a light sleeper then it might be somewhat annoying. \\nThe room was  always clean, with fresh towels and folded linens. The rooms could have been a little better lit. There was only one floor lamp in the corner and lamp between the two beds.\\nThe staff was friendly and helpful. We asked for a authentic Chinese restaurant and she recommended one within walking distance. They also held our bags for after we checked out so we could continue to explore the city on our last day.\\nOutside you are truly in Chinatown. There are vendors right on the street selling their wares. As in other reviews, there is a fish market near the end of the block with the smell of seafood but it is brief as you walk by. Overall, not a big deal.\\nA couple of negatives. It is true that there aren\\'t many &quot;american&quot; places to eat nearby. But we were never in that area much for it to be a factor. Also, anyone can enter the hotel through the front door. A doorman or key card would alleviate any concerns.

For those travelers in the latter category, the Hotel 91 is a good place to spend the night.There are few frills, but the necessities are provided. It is less expensive that most in Manhattan. It is clean. The staff is friendly and helpful. It is located within Chinatown and it is two blocks from the F  subway line. Little Italy is one kilometer away. The location is both a positive and a negative. All of Manhattan is accessible from the hotel, but the hotel is next to the Manhattan Bridge and the traffic, including the noisy subway, runs past the windows all day and night. The windows are double-paned and some noise is deflected, but anyone who has trouble sleeping with urban noise may find nighttime a challenge. The neighborhood around the hotel seems safe, but the stench from fish vendors, sidewalk vegetable stalls, and sewers and drains can be unpleasant. The local merchants seem oblivious to trash and smell and the garbage on the sidewalks lays out an obstacle course.

This is not a hotel to sit about in and luxuriate in your own wealth, whilst taking selfies. If you are expecting the 5* Park Lane Hotel on Central Park, then don\\'t book.\\n\\nThe room was air conditioned, which operated quietly. It was cleaned daily, and had a perfectly acceptable bathroom. Train noise: we were on the 4th floor right next to the Manhattan Bridge and heard it but it didn\\'t wake us. If you are the sort of special snowflake that wakes up when a butterfly breaks wind then it would be worth asking for a room AWAY from the bridge, BEFORE you arrive, or bring ear plugs. At home, we live on a busy A class road and often have the window open so noise at night is not an issue for us. This is entirely subjective and I accept what doesn\\'t bother me, will leave others in tears but I couldn\\'t hear the trains in other parts of the hotel, so its not through out the whole building.\\n\\nThere is no bar or dining but you are in New York. Honestly, if you cant feed and water yourself here then you should perhaps not be allowed to travel without a responsible adult. There is however, tea &amp; coffee making facilities at reception and well stocked vending machines for late night munchies: these take $1 bills and $1, 25, 10 &amp; 5c coins.\\n\\nIt is situated in Chinatown, that\\'s in Lower Manhattan. Again, this is not Wall Street, nor the Upper West Side. You are not in the rarefied environs around the Dakota Building. An area that appears to be made up of predominately working class ethnic Chinese New Yorkers, there are lots of small businesses and Asian food/grocery outlets. Chinatown is busy and cramped and fairly scruffy but that\\'s all part of the charm. Mandarin and/or Cantonese is what you will hear being spoken but we were never made to feel unwelcome.\\n\\nIt is a 5 minute walk to the East Broadway F train subway station. \\n\\nWe were never off this and you need to be brave, take a deep breath and try to master the subway system. As in any major metropolis, this will seem intimidating at first but it really isn\\'t and will make your holiday a lot easier. If you can work out Uptown/Downtown, you have cracked it. You can buy a Metrocard, which you can top up, and use on both buses &amp; the underground. Its $2.75 a trip. If you buy a single trip ticket, its $3. It runs 24hrs a day, and we were on it at 4am and felt safe. The NYC Metro system does not appear to be that user friendly for users with mobility issues, but check that out yourself.\\n\\nWe found the hotel staff friendly and helpful. \\n\\nWe arrived early but were allowed to check in early. Reception staff were courteous.\\n\\nIn summary, if you are self reliant or already know New York, this is a great hotel to comfortably sleep off a hard days tourism.

My goal was to save money on lodging. I was also hopeful that the train noise issue that was repeatedly mentioned was overblown.\\n\\nI ended up being disappointed in my decision. It started at the time of booking. I booked online through their website and never got a confirmation of the booking. I e-mailed them twice, and after the second time, I got a response that the booking was made.\\n\\nThere is a Champion parking garage at the corner of Market and Division that is 1-2 blocks from the hotel. The charge is around $35 per night. You can reserve a spot ahead of time, which is recommended as parking garages tend to fill up quickly. If you reserve in advance, make sure to have your confirmation ready at the time of exit because they cannot look it up through their system. Note: there are no in/out privileges in this parking structure.\\n\\nGetting from the parking structure to the hotel was easy. But the hotel is in Chinatown, which we found to be very dirty, smelly, and congested. As most tourists won\\'t spend a lot of time there, it\\'s not really a big deal. But it\\'s not a nice feeling walking through an area of the town multiple times per day that just isn\\'t appealing.\\n\\nThere is an orange line stop at Grand Street that is around a 10-minute walk from the hotel. This stop will take you directly into mid-town, so you don\\'t have to transfer subway lines to get near Times Square or Central Park.\\n\\nI was disappointed when I realized I was given a room right across from the Manhattan bridge, and on the 6th floor (out of 7 floors). The train noise was probably the loudest in this section of the hotel.\\n\\nAlthough the room had windows inside of windows to help keep the train noise out, it didn\\'t work. I wasn\\'t able to sleep at all the first night. Eventually I got used to the sound, but I never felt like I could reach a deep sleep.\\n\\nThe hotel offers free Wifi, which worked pretty well. It also had an ice machine, handy for those who want to bring a cooler. They offered free instant coffee and HD TV with a lot of channels. Those were all of the amenities.\\n\\nThe rooms were very clean, and the size of the rooms were decent for NYC.\\n\\nLooking back, I wish I spent another $50 per night at a place in a better location or one that didn\\'t have the noise problems that this one does. I would recommend Hotel 91 only to the extreme budget traveler, and only to heavy sleepers.",2,negative

I didn\\'t find the bridge too noisey, but at times you could really hear people on reception talking loudly. \\n\\nRooms are pretty small, but room for 2 double beds, wardrobe, bedside table, desk and TV table. The bathroom is really nice and the room was very clean. \\n\\nThis hotel was great value for money, cost $400 for 2 people for 3 nights, not bad rates considering the location, 10 minute walk from China Town and close to a subway up to 34th street. Also close enough to walk from the liberty Island ferry and a few other attractions in the lower east side. \\n\\nNice bars and restraunts around Allen and Delancey, went out on Sat night in a place called White Place Slab opposite Starbucks on the corner, very nice night out. \\n\\nAll in all, if you\\'re not an extremely light sleeper and only need somewhere to put your head down that\\'s close midtown then you can go wrong with Hotel 91",5,positive

Overall, I would sum up the experience as good value for money, we booked a few months ago and it was one of the cheapest deals for a 3 star hotel in Manhattan (with flight). The (single queen) room wasn\\'t huge, but there was reasonable space for two. The bed was fairly comfortable and the room and hotel generally were exceptionally clean! The only down side is the subway which backed on to our room but I imagine if you could request a room on the other side there would be no such problem with noise, having said that we were so exhausted after sightseeing and shopping all day that we slept reasonably well anyway. Location: being located in Chinatown there obviously is not much but Chinese restaurants directly outside in terms of food however, there is a diner called \\'Everest\\' Diner about 3-4 blocks away if you turn left out of the hotel which does nice pancakes for breakfast and is fairly reasonable. Wall street, the seaport (for Staten Island Ferry), The World Trade Centre and Century 21 (massive department store with loads of bargains) are about a 15-20 walk away and the subway for stops like Rockerfeller and central Manhattan stops (F train) is about 2-3 blocks away if you turn right outside the hotel (Grand St.) Overall, a very comfortable and enjoyable stay no it may not be the Ritz but you get what you pay for.

Been there, done that, so this time I was ready to try something different. Luckily, Carnegie Hotel was included in my online search of hotels near Central Park, and I booked a room for what I considered a very reasonable rate. The hotel itself is a thin, cool-looking modern building sandwiched in between two older buildings. You can almost miss it if you aren\\'t looking for it. So what do you get compared to the uber expensive central park area hotels? You get a small, sleek, clean lobby with a couple of very pleasant, helpful people at the front desk vs. a spacious statement lobby with a doorman and other people fawning over you. You get a modern, super clean, well-designed, amazingly well-kept bedroom and super comfortable bed that is NYC hotel small. Pretty much par for the course in Manhattan, even for the luxe hotels unless you upgrade to a premium room or a suite. The well-appointed and squeaky clean bathroom was perfect.

Also a 24 hour korean deli/supermarket on the corner of this street.\\n- Also check our aussie restaurant Ruby\\'s for brunch/lunch which isn\\'t too far from this hotel.\\n\\nI enjoyed the trip but I wouldn\\'t stay here again due to the location, tiny room size and the wet bathroom.",3,negative

The hotel was a mixed bag of good and bad.  \\n\\nFirst the Good:\\n\\nReception was easy and the staff were pleasant.  Room was very small but functional and bed comfortable.  I would not recommend this hotel for two people in one room.  All rooms are similar in size and two people would probably fumble over each other all the time.  The location is central and good with lots of food options and services around.  \\n\\nNow the Bad:\\n\\nThey have a 24 hour food stand in the lobby.  The coffee is awful and the staff are rude.  I would never say that if it were a one-off but each time I bought something (maybe five times from different people) I felt as though I was seriously inconveniencing them.   In any event, this is not a big deal.  Can be fixed with new coffee beans and better staff training.  The bigger problem is the elevators.  I think the building is 32 floors and there are only two elevators that service all the floors.  Problem is as you expect, it takes a very long time to get the elevator.  Once I waited about four minutes for the elevator which was too full for me to get on and then another two minutes.  Doesn\\'t sound like a lot but when you are waiting it makes you crazy especially if for example you have to go up and down a lot.   It\\'s worse in the morning and around dinner time.  And oddly, there are almost always more employees in the elevator with large carts than there are guests; so both elevators always feel like service elevators that are often too cramped to get into.  Finally, my sheets had holes in them.  I didn\\'t say anything as I didn\\'t really care.  I presume the cleaner saw the holes on her own and replaced them the next night only to find large brown stains on the sheets she replaced them with.  They of course replaced those.  \\n\\nShort of it is that I think they need to invest in new coffee, new sheets and better training of the food stand staff.   As for elevators, not sure what they can do there other than perhaps have staff only use the elevators other than in emergencies in off hours and not rush hour.   I might say there again only because the price was right but would more likely opt for a different hotel.",3,negative

If your going back to the airport via a black car reception orders you be careful we were told tip inclusive and after you put your pin in as you get out of the car he adds a tip the hotel needs to be aware of this dodgy and looks bad because they ordered it . I sent the hotel a message but got no response it was something you really needed to address at the time.\\nWe also loved the coffee shop down stairs great coffee and breakfast on the run. \\nthanks for our stay",4,positive

It\\'s a $27 ride from the LGA airport and the style here was everything I\\'d want in a city apt. Also close to Empire State building and MSG.  It was compact, but not cramped at all! The room was spacious in areas you\\'d want for like the shower and bed, but not a lot of extra room that you don\\'t end up using.  Our view was incredible on the 27th floor.  The bed touched 2 of the floor-to-ceiling windows and the blackout, automatic shades made it easy to sleep in. The design is modern and trendy with clean lines, and I almost felt like we were in an Ikea sample room at times.  There are about 10 rooms on each floor and 30 or so floors. There\\'s lots of little things I loved about the hotel I\\'ve never noticed about other places.  They didn\\'t have mini soaps, but large bottles to use from.  They had an umbrella to use while you\\'re there which helped on wet trips out. The staff was top notch and we always felt welcome. They had an on site Bodega downstairs that is open 24-7 which was super convenient for our nights staying out late. They have a new trendy on site restaurant that we didn\\'t get to enjoy but heard great things about.\\nThe first floor near the elevators had an assortment of index cards where people wrote suggestions on activities, places to eat, things to see, and we thought that was pretty awesome! The elevators on each floor had different ink variations of that number and it was a unique and cool way to add a little flair to each floor. Free wifi was quick and easy to connect to. We will certainly be staying here again next time we come to NYC.",5,positive

I have stayed in many hotels of all kinds in many places worldwide especially in NYC. What you get in Arlo is a room with everything you may need without excess space. The room may have less floor space but they have a good height. First you enter through a modern reception that is opposite a trendy &quot;Bodega&quot; concept that is open 24 hours. It\\'ll sell you everything from a cup of coffee, a soda, to a slice of Massoni Pizza. The reception furniture is a modern mid century revival and it leads you either to a restaurant: Massoni, or to the elevator hallway, it also has a staircase that leads you to two &quot;studios&quot; one is a large area with sofas and lounge chairs with a large meeting room table and a library, the other just the large meeting room table and a library, there is also a bar on this floor and an open court that is carefully and tastefully designed.\\n\\nThe room itself is a combination full bath and bed area. The bath and toilet area is encased with privacy glass on one side and the sink, a utility stool and a seat stool desk combination on the other side. The shower/bath area is separated from the bed area by a good size hanging closet, that has a safe, and small fridge, and above a large cabinet you can close with a door. The bed virtually covers almost all the space, but it does have a small seating couch on one side, a good size nightstand, a nicely finished headboard. The bed is good, not the best, but it is good. The bedding is euro white, better quality. The TV is a newer model, nice size, and you get most of your desired channels. WiFi is included and it has great reception. You can move the TV as you want with its full motion bracket, and this allows you to connect any HDMI if you want to use your laptop or iPad.\\n\\nThings I liked was the service, how nicely appointed the rooms are. The reception and the studios were great and I didn\\'t feel crowded. For an NY visit where you want to be out of the room most of the time. This is a nice place to be. \\n\\nNow, for family travel, you have to consider a larger room and the mechanics of the bathroom sounds and privacy glass. If that isn\\'t an issue for you. This is a great place. Though do note that many modern hotels are going this route, even larger ones like the Riu Times Square. \\n\\nSome reviews here complain about heat and noise. I adjusted the temperature as I wanted and had no issues. As to noise, the only noise that bothered me were the clocks installed in the headboard. I think a better redesign using  a led display should fix this. It\\'s a nice design to have them, but the ticking is loud. As instructed I pulled them out and removed the batteries and no issues. This is a great hotel and I am hoping many more like these spring up elsewhere. I will stay here again if the prices are commensurate enough.",5,positive

Too the point that on two occasions I decided not to risk going back up to my room as it would take too long to go up and down. \\n-Front desk staff definitely not as friendly or welcoming as the Arlo Hudson Square (which was one of the reasons I loved the Hudson Sq property)\\n-The bar on the 2nd floor beside the amazing common space doesn\\'t open until 5pm.

I have not regretted it. Currently in my room, awaiting to check out and it\\'s been a great stay. The staff are the friendliest I\\'ve encountered in NY. Great welcome upon arrival. Straight in my room despite it being 1.30pm when I arrived. I\\'ve stayed in other hotels in the US where they\\'ve reconditioned an older hotel, but NoMad have really done this well and despite the odd smell in the corridor on my floor (8) which I suspect might come from previous smoking floor?

I really liked the inhouse products too, so much so that I\\'m considering buying some. One of the best things is the fact that this room doesn\\'t have lots of red or blue lights from electronic equipment to affect your sleep. Expertly designed. Yes the rooms are small, but for me in an urban queen as a single traveller it was perfect. Much more storage than when I stayed at The Standard. Really smart under bed storage, perfect for your suitcase. All those things that annoy you about hotel rooms have been addressed such as a full length mirror, decent TV channels. I love the fact you have a mini fridge that\\'s empty so you can put your own choices in there.

I never normally stay mid town, normally chelsea/meatpacking/lower east side, but I really appreciated being near so much and in walking distance to so many great areas.

From the moment that I booked with Arlo I felt at home and well taken care of.  Soon after booking I reached out to inquire about room amenities; in particular I was looking to have Rose pedals and chocolate covered strawberries in the room upon our arrival.  This is when I met Elizabeth Santana.  I truly couldn\\'t thank her enough for the job that she did.  Elizabeth was a pleasure to speak to over the phone or via email any time I reached out to her and from that point on I knew we were in good hands.  Not only did Elizabeth personally decorate our room, but she was able to get us a marvelous view of the Empire State Building, she got our room set up early and allowed us to check-in ahead of schedule, and she even provided us with a complimentary bottle of champagne.  Without Elizabeth I\\'m sure our stay at the Arlo would have been fine, but thanks to Elizabeth Santana and her EXCEPTIONAL service I refuse to stay anywhere else in New York City whenever I visit.  The hotel it self is very clean, smells great and has an amazingly warm and friendly staff.  although we were not able to dine at Massoni I\\'ve heard great things and can vouch for the drinks at Barlo and the Heights, they were great.  Chips &amp; Guac a the Heights is to die for and I highly recommend to anybody that visits.

The rooms are small but they make efficient use of the space and there is plenty of storage space under the bed for your suitcases. The bathroom was a full sized and plenty of room. Only thing I didn\\'t care for was the shower only has glass on half and you have to use a curtain for the rest which doesn\\'t come all the way down so your floor definitely gets wet, even when using the bath mat. Not a huge deal though. The bed was large and very comfortable. The pillows were a little too soft but it wasn\\'t anything horrible. The closet was a little small but we made it work. Loved the automatic blackout shades for when we wanted to sleep in a little bit some mornings. My only issue with our particular room (1901) is while it had great views from one window (the New York Life building is stunning), the other side was nothing but a brick wall. I asked for a higher room at booking and once again after we were assigned this room but they weren\\'t able to accommodate the request. So that was a bummer but it is what it is. The staff was very friendly. The only thing I wish they had done was put in a service elevator for staff and rooftop guests. From the time people get off work to the time the rooftop bar closes, the elevators are packed with people and it can take a very long time to get to and from your room. Also, the staff uses the regular elevators so we frequently had to stop at multiple floors to pickup/drop off staff members. However, in the grand scheme of things, this isn\\'t a deal breaker.

Therefore, the room is relatively smaller but the decor is absolutely modern, space is very well designed and you sense the influence of European style. \\n\\nIt\\'s all about how we work and relax these days, so here is the break down of what you need to know and why you instantly fall in love with it.\\n\\nWork:\\n\\nWifi - Connection is wonderful. I encountered no problems whatsoever. And you don\\'t have to pay for that (hmmm Sheraton...)\\n\\nCo-working Space - Floor two is a lounge style with work desks and outlet on one side.

It\\'s a thing in New York. You have to come happy hour at some sort of rooftop bar. Arlo nailed it. You have a 270 degrees view of the city, the empire state building. The drinks are on the pricy end (12-16 per cocktail) but the selections and executions are good so pay up!\\n\\nBar #2 - located on the second floor. You can consider this is a lobby bar but on the second floor. A big lounge space where sometimes there are jazz or musicians performing in the evening\\n\\nYoga in the morning - Arlo partnered with an external studio to bring yoga classes to the hotel rooftop. I signed up the one on Monday morning and it was wonderful (7-8am). If you are a guest you can sign up for a discounted price of $15. Gotta try it!\\n\\nBiking in the city - One of the best things staying at Arlo is to use their free bikes to go around the city. If you live long enough you know during certain hours the street traffic is so bad your best option to go from point A to point B is either walk or a much faster option, bike.

OUT/com/60763/10541730/522433871.html,Arlo NoMad,"""Booked 4 nights here for business in Manhattan. I have stayed at a competing &quot;micro&quot; hotel on several occasions and was familiar with the room style before I booked it. I visit NYC 3-4 times per year and spend 75+ nights per year in a hotel.\\n\\nBased on reviews, I reached out to the GM via email to ensure that a &quot;sky view&quot; King would actually have a a view.  She replied promptly and stated that they recently changed that category to higher floors based on guest feedback.  Since that was the reason I selected this hotel, I was glad to hear that and pleased with the quick reply.\\n\\nArrived about 4 pm and room was ready.  Agent never did confirm my room type so I asked about it after she gave me keys to ensure I was not going to go upstairs to the wrong room. Usually it\\'s common to confirm the room type so that was noticeable.\\n\\nThe room - It\\'s very small. And yes, I knew that going in but what I did not account for is the poor use of space.  The hanging area is too short to hang slacks without folding them. The cabinet above the hanging area is very tall but has no shelves.  Perhaps it is for your suitcase? I had to pile clothes about 8 inches high on the base and was constantly having to shuffle through it. Small shelf was primarily occupied by the phone and clock radio. Zero drawers in the room and only one other retractable shelf that would house a glass of water or two.  Cannot walk around the bed so if you are with someone they will be climbing over.  TV is on a floor mount that protrudes into the walkway to the bathroom. Shoulder hit that TV at least 3 times in 4 days. Bathroom sink has little storage and they opted not to put another shelf below so it is open the to floor.  The shower is half glass wall and it seems they added a shower curtain solution for the other half as an afterthought.  The space is just poorly designed all the way around and the design is not even conducive for one guest. I cannot imagine two! Climate control in the room is on a motion sensor. It was a real pleasure to come back to a room that was 85 degrees when it\\'s 90 degrees with 90% humidity outside.  Closing the shades in the following days helped a bit but the downside to these all glass rooms is that they are like a hot house and some get full afternoon sun in the Summer months. As a paying customer, I\\'d like to decide myself when to save power and energy.\\n\\nService - upon arrival I called down to ask if the pillows in the room were feather or foam. I honestly could not tell and tags were no help. Spoke to Ethan who was going to find out and call me right back. That was a few weeks ago. Still waiting to hear from him. :) Housekeeping did what they needed to but with such little space it really consisted of making the bed and clean towels.  The cords on the lights above the bed were COATED with 1/3 inch of dust.  Still there when I checked out.  At one point I dropped something on the floor and push the curtain aside. A puff of dust released from the base.  Did the same on the next panel - same dust cloud appeared.  This is not acceptable in any hotel but these tiny rooms in a new building is inexcusable. Housekeeping missed the mark.  My experience improved elsewhere in the hotel. Chris and Marvin in the lobby bar were fantastic. Great service and made for a pleasant stop there or on the roof on several occasions.  Staff on the rooftop bar and the takeout counter in the lobby were also great to deal with.  The truth is, the bar/restaurant staff brought this review to three stars and deserve more but the room and cleanliness won\\'t allow for more. \\n\\nRooftop - love them and hate them. At Arlo, it is open to the public and advertised street side.  Had the unfortunate experience of waiting 25 minutes to access my room because hundreds of people were going to the roof to see the eclipse. A one off for sure but the elevators are truly horrendous.  1 of three goes only to the 9th floor.  Also, ALL of the staff use those elevators to move around the property.  Every time I got in, there was 1-5 team members that had stops 1-2 floors up. Stairs? Service elevator?  Again goes back to poor design.  Many reviews mention the elevators and others do not. I can only assume it\\'s based on occupancy and time of day. It is one of the worst elevator setups I have experienced in NYC. \\n\\nI wanted to like this hotel and was excited to stay here. The design flaws in the room are too much to get past. I may visit again for the bar/restaurant staff but I will be going back to the other micro-hotel with superbly designed spaces, full room automation and a gorgeous rooftop lounge for hotel guests only.",3,negative

Housekeeping was fantastic, providing us with fresh clean towels everyday, and every evening we came back to the room we were greeted with a clean and tidy space.
