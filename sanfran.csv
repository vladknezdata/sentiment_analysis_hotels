Also, I need to say that the personnel was very friendly (despite my bad mood after a long trip and various surprises). Also, we managed to find a free parking spot on the street just in front for the night, so that was great!\\n\\nNEGATIVE: first of all, I really dislike places that display one price, I book against that price (displayed 85 $ when I booked my night and that was what was on my booking confirmaiton) - once arrived in the hotel this and that and what-not was added and all of a sudden the room was 115 (plus 5$ because i paid by card... - WHO travels with cash in 2016?). I understand that in the US the &quot;tax is always added and not displayed&quot; but as a non-american, it is hard to understand that so MUCH is added and I tend to feel &quot;cheated&quot; - why not just tell me up front how much I will have to pay? \\nALSO: yes, rooms are small, and yes, it\\'s quite noisy (earplugs!) and there was no curtain to make the room dark (sleeping mask!) \\n\\nOVERALL: I expected worse (been in many similar price-ranged hotels in mission disctrict) so was totally OK with it, and happy with the service provided but a bit in a bad mood for the price-surprise and had a hard time to sleep due to noise. \\n\\nI don\\'t mind mission district, and find it convenient as many shops/places to eat around, but I would maybe not send my teenage kids (if I had any) here alone (it\\'s mission district - google it if you don\\'t know what that means before you go..... ) \\n\\nIf you seek to pay around 100$ per night in San Fran, this is what you get (or - look on the motels and inn\\'s rather to get private bathrooms, sometimes they have rates down to 100$).",3,negative

Eek, I was thinking.  We\\'re more accustomed to staying in Union Square and paying an arm and a leg.  Jumped on Yelp and saw many positive reviews and the photos looked promising. \\n\\nLOCATION:\\nThey\\'re right on Market conveniently located in between the Castro &amp; Church Street MUNI stations.  A handful of bars, coffee shops, and 2 Walgreens are nearby.  Uber X rides from here to SFO $28, and to Fisherman\\'s Wharf $13. \\n\\nREGISTRATION:\\nThe tiny office is out front.  Check in was friendly and fairly easy, but their computer\\'s swiper couldn\\'t read my brand new credit card\\'s strip for some reason, so I was forced to use another one.  They have free maps of San Francisco, the Castro, and Fisherman\\'s Wharf along with a candy dish full of Jolly Ranchers lol!\\n\\nCheck out was fast and easy, and we even pre-booked a room for next year\\'s Pride weekend!\\n\\nPARKING:\\nFree for 1 car and on-site!  How do you like them apples?  \\n\\nROOM:\\nLike others have said, the whole place was remodeled, and was super clean and modern on the inside.  Definitely don\\'t judge a book by its cover.  Gate access into the elevator and stairwells were sensor key-controlled, as were the room doors.  We were in a king deluxe on the top floor (3).  The room was large and roomy, with a 3-seat pullout sofa, single sofa, and desk with room to spare.  A remote controlled electric heater that looked like a flat screen TV complete with fireplace-like visual effects was mounted on the wall and kept the room warm &amp; toasty.  A ductless a/c unit was mounted above the bed.  The bed and pillows were comfortable.  Our room was facing residential 15th Street so it wasn\\'t noisy at all. \\n\\nBATHROOM:\\nAll the fixtures, flooring, and hardware were new and modern, with a single basin, large closet, and shower/tub with skylight.  Water pressure was sufficient and drainage was quick.  \\n\\nAMENITIES:\\nFree and strong WiFi, safe, iron &amp; board, hair dryer, coffee maker, mini refrigerator.\\n\\nTIP:\\nFree coffee was offered to BMI guests across the street at Sweet Inspiration Bakery for some reason but we never checked it out.  \\n\\nOVERALL:\\nTruly, a diamond in the rough.  We\\'re total fans!\\n\\n----------------------\\n\\nSECOND VISIT - JUNE 2017:\\nAfter a surprisingly nice stay back in November 2016, we decided to make advanced reservations for Pride 2017, in the same room (third level along 15th Street at the back of the property).  Done, or so we thought. \\n\\nFast forward seven months and my spouse says we\\'d better confirm our reservations as we didn\\'t hear from Beck\\'s.  Oddly, they couldn\\'t find it.  After several more calls, we find out they have a reservation with the exact stay dates, held under my last name, but my middle names were listed as the first name, the credit card number wasn\\'t ours, and we\\'re not from Texas.  Okay...  We\\'d better find another room!?\\n\\nMy spouse jumps on booking.com and luckily finds another room at Beck\\'s, though at a higher rate and in a smaller room.  \\n\\nSERVICE:\\nBecause we arrived earlier than the 3pm check in time and it was Pride 2017 weekend, we couldn\\'t get into our room any earlier.  But, they were nice enough to hold our luggage in the office.  \\n\\nOne day we didn\\'t receive housekeeping service.  The housekeeper claims we had the DND sign on, but I remember flipping it over.  And, the sign was missing from our door when we came back due to gusty winds.  \\n\\nROOM:\\nWe ended up on the third level again, but this time along Market Street in an ADA (handicap) room which is a lot smaller and noisier than our last digs (a noisy door-slamming neighbor and that steel on steel train that rumbled by every now and then).  No wonder why there were ear plugs in the bathroom, lol.  \\n\\nThe king bed and pillows were comfy, the a/c and free WiFi strong.  A small safe, coffee machine and mini refrigerator were available.  \\n\\nBATHROOM:\\nDue to its ADA-compliance, the bathroom was huge.  The roll-in, oversized shower had good pressure.  The single basin was a little too shallow but best suits wheelchair guests.  A skylight provided additional lighting. \\n\\nTHE EMAIL:\\nOne day after checking in, we received that &quot;I knew it&quot; email, wondering if we were still coming.  Turns out that the mysterious reservation was in fact ours, not for someone from Texas.  The guy who set it up for us last year screwed something up, majorly.  We were not charged any penalties.  I guess both parties failed to confirm an attached email address which would\\'ve provided some insight.  Mistakes happen, but unquestionably, a one star loss.  \\n\\nOVERALL:\\nWe\\'re still fans of this place and will for sure return.",4,positive

You can tell they spent some big bucks on the remodel. Access to the rooms is now very restricted which has taken away the reputation and ability as a place for a quickie anonymous sex. Felt very safe on the grounds and in our room.\\n\\nI have only one complaint and for a \\'motor lodge\\' it is a large issue as far as I\\'m concerned. I called the hotel reception three times over four weeks prior to our arrival and asked about parking. I stated that we would not be arriving to the hotel until around 9pm - and in their opinion would we have a problem finding a parking space in their lot as we were planning on having a rental car. I said if they felt parking would be an issue - we would forego the rental car and just take a taxi or Uber etc. Every time I called, I was told that parking would NOT be an issue at all and that there were spaces way in the back that people always forget about.\\n\\nNeedless to say, parking WAS an issue and the lot was completely filled every night we were there. They had NO suggestions or options for alternative parking when their lot was filled.\\n\\nOnce we finally got a spot, we never moved our car as we knew we\\'d never get a parking space once we left the property.\\n\\nSo if you are planning on having a car - do NOT plan on having a parking spot at Beck\\'s.

There are also plenty of good restaurants and bars within a few minutes walk.  I would recommend Sweet Inspiration opposite for breakfast and Brewcade next door for some drinks/fun.  Staff were very polite and helpful, letting us leave our baggage after checkout until our taxi was due that evening.\\n\\nThe only reason I am giving Becks 4 stars is because of the noise.  With the tram right outside, people walking past your room and it being a relatively busy area it can get quite load.  Maybe sound proofing the windows might help.\\n\\nAll in all we enjoyed our stay and would return when back in San Francisco.",4,positive

It\\'s within very easy walking distance to the Castro area, and if supplies are needed, there\\'s a CVS, a Walgreens and a Safeway grocery store nearby.

As far as Beck\\'s goes as a facility, I was impressed with the room size (a queen with view), the decor, the comfort of the bed and the quality of the bedding. That said, there are some minor issues, and potentially a big one. Two minor issues in the large bathroom; no way to plug the sink, and a lack of a towel hook near the shower: they were on the opposite wall. It was either place a bath towel in the sink before starting to shower, or drip across the floor. The other potential issue is the noise from the street. My room was on the front of the property, right over the office. Typical street/traffic noise wasn\\'t too bad, but there were a few of the vintage streetcars that were quite load.

For those who are not familiar with San Francisco, Lombard aka U.S. 101 which goes through town and over the Golden Gate Bridge and is one of the busier thoroughfares in the city.  If your room is on Lombard you will hear a pretty constant stream of car and truck traffic.\\n  \\nThe hotel is nothing fancy, but more expensive than a similar two star hotel in other cities.  Remember it is San Francisco! Our kids live a few blocks from the hotel so it is convenient.\\n  \\nOn our second visit to the cow Hollow Inn, I noticed a couple of things on the website when I was making my reservation.    They offer, Standard, Deluxe and Superior rooms with relative increasing rates.  Typically this means bigger rooms, maybe a sofa etc. Links to the room descriptions were broken.  I got that 404 error message.   I was content with the standard room price.  \\n\\nThey also had a drop down list of requests.  For example you could ask for a room on the 1st, Floor, 2nd Floor, 3rd Floor, &quot;Back Room If Possible&quot;, Crib, Early Arrival, Extra Pillow, Foam Pillow\\u2026 etc.  Oh yea refrigerator $5.00 per day.  I thought that was nice so I requested a back room and foam pillow.\\n\\nOn the day before we were to arrive I received a call from the hotel confirming my reservation, acknowledging that I had requested a back room.  They mentioned that I had selected a standard room and that the back rooms are deluxe or better so if I wanted a back room away from Lombard,  it would be $10 more per day.\\n\\nI told them I was confused because the website did not indicate a surcharge for a back room request, nor a surcharge for any other request except if I wanted a refrigerator.\\n  \\nI told them that I found their request offensive and that it seemed like a shake down for more money.  I ask them to grant my request for a back room (they already indicated it was possible) and that I should not be charged.  They said that they could not honor this request, but they would pass on my concern to the owners.\\n  \\nWhen I checked in the next day we were located in a room facing Lombard and no foam pillow.  I am one of those foolish people that does not like to complain all the time on small issues so I did not. At the same respect I do not like to take be taken advantage of either.\\n.  \\nThe hotel was clean, but had an antiseptic smell in the halls\\u2026sort of like a hospital.  The house keeping staff was efficient and the room was cleaned promptly, though low grade shampoo and conditioner.\\n\\nIt is not much money, but probably an indication of the owners mindset.  I am choosing to vote with my dollars and will be selecting another hotel for our next visit to the kids.\\n\\nIf you must stay at the Cow Hollow Inn, beware of the noise on Lombard and the sneaky front desk staff looking to up-charge you for a simple request.

OUT/com/60713/112293/20431925.html,Cow Hollow Inn and Suites,"""My husband and I stayed at the Cow Hollow Inn September 20 - 25.  We booked it based on TripAdvisor reviews.  I\\'m very glad I found this hotel here because the only way to book is directly through the hotel (no Orbitz, hotels.com, etc).  \\n\\nThe hotel is very easy to get to and is in a great neighborhood.  I was a little worried that there might not be much around the hotel since it\\'s not near Union Square or Fisherman\\'s Wharf, but there\\'s actually quite a few little shops and at least 30 restaurants within a 2 block radius of the hotel.  The first night we were there, we walked to the bay - it was a quick 1/4-1/2 mile walk - which was a great way to look at all the million-dollar houses in the area (what beautiful architecture!)  It\\'s an upscale neighborhood and I always felt safe outside.\\n\\nThere are several bus stops within 2-3 blocks.  We used the bus system the entire time we were there - it\\'s definitely the easiest way to get around.  We did get a rental car, but only used it to get to/from the airport and for a trip to Muir Woods one day.  The hotel does have free parking.\\n\\nOur room was cleaned very well every day.  We didn\\'t have any interaction with hotel staff other than check-in and check-out.  I recommend bringing a key chain because all they give you is a loose key.\\n\\nWe did not have any problem with noise, however my husband often falls asleep with the TV on, so the two of us are probably just used to some noise.  Our room was on the first floor facing Steiner street (I\\'ve attached a photo taken from our window, facing the corner of Steiner and Lombard).\\n\\nThings that didn\\'t add or take away from our stay, but I would recommend to the hotel management:\\n- The pictures on the website seriously need to be updated.  The ugly wallpaper in those pictures is no longer in the rooms.  Our room was much more pleasant looking in person than in the website pictures.\\n- It would\\'ve been nice to have a comfy chair or small couch in the corner of our room.  The bay window is lovely, but there\\'s just this big empty space next to it.  Our room had a single king bed, so the double bed rooms probably fill this space better.\\n- I wouldn\\'t book my stay on the website because it does not have a secure server (http vs. https).\\n- When I went to check out at 5:30am, no one was at the front desk.  After a few minutes, I thought I heard someone rustling in back, so I called out &quot;Hello??&quot;  That did the trick. :o)  I think if employees are going to hang out in back during slow times, a bell on the door or on the desk would be an easy solution.\\n\\nWe ate at many of the restaurants close to our hotel and enjoyed them all:\\n- Country Sky Chinese (across Steiner street) - We loved this place!  Our food was fantastic and the staff was incredibly sweet.\\n- Barney\\'s Gourmet Hamburgers (next door on Steiner) - Food was good, but the wait was long (and the restaurant wasn\\'t full).  I\\'d still recommend this place - it seems as though the entire town is short on wait staff, and everyone works very hard.\\n- Izzy\\'s Steak and Chops (across Steiner street) - This was a treat.  I had Swordfish and just loved it, my husband had lamb and said it was good, but not the best he\\'d had.  This was the most expensive place we visited.\\n- Mel\\'s Diner (across Lombard street) - This is a 50\\'s style, jukebox diner.  Food was good, milkshakes were great.  We enjoyed our meal, but it didn\\'t really make me think of &quot;San Francisco&quot;.\\n- Squat and Gobble (on Chestnut, about a 2 block walk from the hotel) - We had lunch here and it was fantastic.  Lots of salads and crepes.\\n- Korean BBQ (I can\\'t remember the actual name of the restaurant, but it\\'s right next to the hotel on Steiner street) - We got take-out one night and ate it in our hotel room.  My husband really enjoyed this, but it was the first time either of us had eaten Korean food, so I can\\'t tell you how authentic it was.",4,positive

This is great if you plan to stay up late and party with the young crowd.  However,  do not stay here if you want to sleep before 2 am or have young kids.  The rooms have no ventilation so your options are to sleep in a stuffy, hot room or have the windows open.  With the windows open you can hear loud music, loud voices, people yelling back and forth and even conversations on the street. This goes on all night long only getting a little quieter after 2 am but then the garbage trucks showed up at 5 ish.  I think the buildings cause the noise to echo b/c we were on the second floor and it sounded like the people were outside our window.  Also the windows are huge and have no screens so this is NOT a good place for little kids.  It is clean and the noise is not the fault of the management.  We did think it was a bit pricey (over $300/night) as the rooms were dated and smelled musty (it actually smelled liked curry as well but maybe someone was cooking as these units have kitchens.)

OUT/com/60713/112293/106402084.html,Cow Hollow Inn and Suites,"""The Cow Hollow Suites are actually a companion property to the Cow Hollow Motor Inn, which in contrast is comprised of nicely appointed, large hotel rooms (check in is shared, but the Suites have their own entrance).  We\\'ve actually stayed in both and now opt for the Suites as the better albeit pricier choice.  Why?  Well, the Suites are actually like renting a small condo that is serviced like a hotel room, and they are at least as comfortable as those offered by the large &quot;suites&quot; chains.  There\\'s nothing like lounging in an actual living room after a day of out and about, or even dining in if one so chooses.  A significant advantage for the the Cow Hollow is that it is located in an area that has any number of dining options and for virtually any taste and budget.  Moreover, the Cow Hollow includes parking in its room rates, no small matter in a town as expensive to park in as San Francisco.  If there is any reason to knock the place, it is that the decor of the Suites is a bit dated, but then that\\'s also part of the charm since everything about them in our experience is quite comfy and well-maintained.",5,positive

The rooms at the motel are clean and updated with wifi, and the staff at the front desk most helpful. And the free parking is a definite plus.

When I arrived at hotel, a customer ahead of me sounded like he was checked in even though it was early.  I was just going to ask if I could park my car and then would check in later.  But the staff said, at least let us check to see if there is a room available now for you -- AND THERE WAS!!!!  He let me check in early (wish I had his name, Asian gentleman).  I said all I wanted to do was find out if I could park my car until 4 pm (regular check in time).  How awesome he was able to get me in -- how many hotels have you heard of every doing that for you!  And he said, even if my room wasn\\'t available, I could have still parked my car -- this hotel is NEAR EVERYTHING!!!!  You couldn\\'t ask for a better location.  I walk down to the marina and around to restaurants.  It was just too easy!  With free parking -- no breakfast but 10% off if you show your hotel room key right next door but it was always crowded so didn\\'t use this feature --walking distance to EVERYTHING and such friendly staff, it was perfect for our stay which was half pleasure and half business.  The room had 2 beds and was great for us so we each had our own.  It was a corner unit so lots of room.  The only recommendation I would make is don\\'t get room on 1st floor above their underground parking, cars going in and out honked to make sure no one coming around corner pulling in and out of garage.  It wasn\\'t often, but it did happen.  Also, water is VERY HOT so be careful adjusting temp or just turning on/off.  There was also a limited amount of plugs.

OUT/com/60713/112293/169254664.html,Cow Hollow Inn and Suites,"""A couple of things were less than ideal, but overall this was a good stay in a lively part of the city. Heeding Tripadvisor warnings about traffic noise if your room faces busy Lombard Street, we asked for one at the back of the hotel. We were initially very pleased with our room, 215, because it overlooked the sides or backs of other buildings rather than overlooking a street and was absolutely silent when we checked in. But by early evening, it became like party central. It turned out that the awning over the courtyard below our window covers the heated patio of Isa Restaurant on Steiner Street. Because it\\u2019s not a solid structure, sound leaks out \\u2013 loud conversation and shrieks of laughter till around midnight. I realize the hotel can\\u2019t control the noise from other businesses, but upgrading the windows from single to double glazing would surely make affected rooms quieter. (The hotel\\u2019s floor plan indicates that rooms 212, 213 and 216 also have this problem.)\\n\\nThe other issue we had was a noisy toilet. Every five minutes or so during our first night the toilet would refill, though it hadn\\u2019t been used or flushed. We asked the front desk the next morning to have it checked, but when we returned in the evening, the toilet was still gurgling away. However, as mysteriously as it started, the noise stopped a couple of hours later, and we had an undisturbed sleep.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s it for the negatives. Among the things we appreciated were the location of the hotel. You can walk to the Palace of Arts, then along Crissy Field shoreline park to Fort Point, which puts you right underneath the Golden Gate Bridge. Alamo Square, location of the iconic Victorian houses known as the Painted Ladies or Postcard Row, is a ten-minute drive from the hotel. (We actually found many of the other houses on the square more interesting.) The Haas-Lilienthal house, a Victorian mansion preserved as a museum and open for tours, is five or six minutes away by car.\\n\\nSan Francisco isn\\u2019t the easiest city to find parking, so it was great to know we were assured a space in the hotel\\u2019s underground lot (one per room guaranteed, included in the room rate). The room was big, with lots of space for all our stuff. (The hotel recommends not leaving valuables in your car.) The bed was very comfortable, we always had hot water and a good wifi connection, and the front desk staff were pleasant and helpful.\\n\\nYou\\u2019ll find lots of restaurants in the area. For breakfast we really liked Mel\\u2019s Diner across the street on Lombard; Bay Watch, pretty well next door to the hotel, also did a good job. And Amici\\u2019s, opposite the hotel on Steiner Street, serves excellent gluten-free pizza.

There was a large crack line inside the bathroom sink &amp; the faucet handles were loose. I\\'m no giant at 5\\'6&quot; but I had to duck under the shower head to get the water stream on me. We did stay at one of their sister properties which was in much better shape. Cow Hollow is in great need of a deep cleaning, better yet, a total make over.\\nAlso if you book through a 3rd party website be aware you will be placed in a room facing thunderous Lombard St. It was a bit unnerving when the whole room shook from large vehicles passing by thinking it was possibly an earthquake.

It was comfortable and clean. There wasn\\'t really a &quot;front desk&quot; so access to &quot;front desk&quot; type things was not something we did. It was more of an office where you checked in and out and that was it. We walked everywhere from this Hotel. To the Fisherman\\'s Wharf for our Alcatraz Tour and other Wharf fun - you can spend a lot of time there - so much to do. We took the Trolley car, we walked Lombard St, we used the Hop on Hop off Tour bus to access and tour the other areas of the City and we used Uber if we found ourselves too far away. Using a car in this City is not the best way to get around. We loved the City Lights Bookstore and the Vesuvio Caf\\u00e9 in the North Beach area, as well as The  Wharf, Chinatown, Haight Ashbury, Telegraph Hill, Golden Gate Park districts. I would most definitely stay at Cow Hollow Inn again.

Really couldn\\'t fault this hotel for a city break. Great location by Union Square , right on the cable car route, easy to get about from here and all the shopping you could want on the doorstep. The hotel staff were all super helpful and welcoming. Edward was able to help us with our attraction tickets too. We found the hotel to be charming, it\\'s only small and boutique style but with huge amounts of character and a nice feel to it. The log fire was burning in the mornings when it was chilly and a bit foggy outside. It all added to the atmosphere of the hotel. We enjoyed free coffee each morning in the lounge area before heading out for the day. Our room was spotlessly clean and tidy, cosy , nice white towels, iron and hairdryer came in handy and it was a bonus to have coffee in the room. Don\\'t expect a huge room as this is an old building and is in keeping with the old style buildings which to us was much nicer than a big chain hotel that you can stay in anywhere in the world. This felt like San Francisco. Couldnt fault this hotel it was perfect for what we wanted from our city break. Thank you ",5,positive

The 1st 2 times, the rooms, although very small, suited our purpose, especially since it\\'s located very near the theater district and the beautiful shopping area of Union Square. It was great to be able to go downstairs to an adjoining room in the morning and have a nicely prepared continental breakfast assorted teas and coffee. Since our last visit they have done away with the breakfast and raised the room prices. This last time we visited, we got a room at the far end of a long, dark,narrow hall with a view of an alley. The bathroom was so small that you could use the toilet and brush your teeth at the same time. The king-sized bed was far too soft and had seen better days as I kept rolling into a \\'rut\\' spot. They had also changed the former quality of the toiletries. The brand that was provided this time was much cheaper. I think our next visit to Union Square will be at the Palace Hotel. Same price range but much higher quality and standards. The Cartwright looks beautiful from the lobby, so it\\'s very deceiving.",3,negative

And rooms, though renovated some, still feel of that vintage. At least the lobby/reception area feels the same. The staff is quite helpful and you\\'ll find travel info and daily newspapers just around the corner from the lobby reception desk. Also, up on the mezzanine you\\'ll find additional brochures. My room was small and it seemed a little stuffy. But the windows opened and there was a heater and a ceiling fan to help out. My room had a coffee maker and the hotel also served free coffee and tea in the morning in the back lobby. There was also a lobby bar but it doesn\\'t seem to get much use. But the location is what\\'s important here. You\\'ll be right off of Powell Street by Union Square with access to a multitude of restaurants, shops, and even the famous cable car system. Walk to Macy\\'s, Chinatown, and the San Francisco Centre (shops). Buses stop everywhere nearby.",3,negative

OUT/com/60713/112325/468042201.html,"The Cartwright Hotel - Union Square, BW Premier Collection","""Despite the fact that the hotel was currently undergoing additional refurbishment during our recent stay, it was comfortable and very easy to navigate to from the airport, without using any high price transfer shuttles. Would recommend catching the BART train to Powell Street,then either the tram or walk up 3-4 blocks past Union Square into Sutter Street. Don\\'t be surprised that the hotel isn\\'t actually on Union Square, but I guess is close enough to get away with it.\\nUpon arrival we were greeted by the management team on the front desk who promptly checked us in so we were able to access our room immediately, which was really nice. Upon leaving the cases we were then able to spend time outside exploring the city after a 11 hour flight. The Concierge was also able to assist with any questions that were raised.\\nThe room which was allocated to us was OK, with ensuite bathroom and walk in wardrobe for storage. Decor could be a little bit more updated, but other than that it served our needs, we didn\\'t plan on staying in all the time. There was a coffee machine in the room and only 2 sachets of coffee to use. One of us was a prolific tea drinker so little disappointed that this facility wasn\\'t available to us. Other items in room included iron, mounted TV unit and a hairdryer, which was hung up on the back of the bathroom door in a black bag. My only concern with this area is should you attempt to visit the bathroom during the middle of the night it would be wise to use the lights, as the robe/towel hook on the inside of the bathroom door is very dangerous and it is at eye level, so if you are still half asleep you could possibly injure yourself.\\nIn the morning there is complimentary coffee and Tea available from the lobby, if you require food however there are a few local places to check out. Lori\\'s Diner is just a few yards down the street, Sears Fine Foods is on Powell Street ( highly recommended) and if you go down to Fisherman\\'s Wharf please do look in on the Wipeout restaurant bar, delicious breakfast brunch meal. You can even have your picture taken with a hunky surfer!\\nOther things to make sure that you do, find Lombard Street the road that zigzags left to right down the steep descent, cable car from Powell Street to Fisherman\\'s Wharf, get a 1,2 or 3 day pass for the trams from the local Walgreens shop, across the road from the hotel. When at the Wharf find Jefferson Street and purchase a bus tour ticket from the Big Bus Company, they provide great tours during day and one at night, places for night tour go quickly and you need to be in a queue in time. Watch out for those people who arrive late and attempt to get on the bus, it doesn\\'t work so don\\'t try it! After the bus tour pop into Boudin and have the sourdough bread soup, very tasty. Take a short walk to Pier 39 and meet the sea lions, noisy but funny at times. A trip to San Francisco is nothing unless you visit the island of Alcatraz, the most infamous prison. And book a bike with Blazing Saddles so that you can cycle over The Golden Gate bridge down into Sausolito and then choose to either cycle back, or tour the town catch a meal at the Burger Restaurant then wait for ferry to take you back. Get some nice views of the bridge and of Alcatraz Island as you pass.\\nLeaving was very easy, check out time is normally 12pm but if you need to leave cases behind until a later flight time the hotel staff were happy to accommodate any such requests. Once again catch the BART train back to the airport for $8.95 per person\\n\\nAll in all a thoroughly enjoyable stay at The Cartwright Hotel, Union Square",4,positive

It also offered valet parking which appealed at $40 plus taxes. And along with the tip came. to $50. Now we know the lie of the land, it would have been very easy to offload luggage then drive round the corner to Geary St and park ourselves for $22 - 29. Seemed to be several overnight car parks close by. And the hotel would have told us where. Nice foyer, staff a tad stiff especially the lady on check out when I queried the $25 charge on my master card I was told that this is common practise to hold a pending deposit against damage. A week later still waiting for the refund, probably the worse we stayed in during our trip. Very compact looked into a tiny back alley with air con units. Minutest bathroom ever. But good hot shower. Security on the door looked weak and we put our bags against it at night.very stuffy and stale smelling room . Woman next door had a long ranting conversation on the phone around 3.am.

We weren\\'t expecting much.  Upon check-in we were given an upgrade to a King suite (we originally reserved a King room).  The suite was awesome!  Not the best views, but we could do some people watching on the street below, the windows opened to allow cool, fresh air in.  The bathroom was huge and the bed was the most comfortable bed we\\'ve slept in in years!  In fact, I\\'m mad at myself for forgetting to look to see what kind of mattress it was.  There was a coffee maker and mini fridge in the room, plus they offered coffee in the lobby in the mornings. The building is older, but with character and nice furnishings.  The elevator and stairs were a little small/tight, but nothing to complain about.  They even had some treats in the lobby for our dog. The only issues we had were minor: 1. one of the TV remotes didn\\'t fully work, the volume was funky.  No big deal because the other remote worked for both TVs. 2. the shower did not have a &quot;tub,&quot; but was more or less flat with the rest of the bathroom flooring, just a slight slant to keep the water in the &quot;tub&quot; area.  The shower head (a removable, hand held head) was pointed straight at the shower curtain, which allowed the water to spray out the bottom and extend to the floor and bath towel.  Again, not a huge deal.  Oh, and our shower was a disabled accessible shower, so it had the folding seat and everything.  Showers in the other rooms might be different.   3. Our dog ended up peeing on the sidewalk across the street, because the closest area to let her go to the bathroom was a long block away at Union Square Park (according to the front desk).  While she could have held it until we got to the park, as a dog, she didn\\'t know how close the park was!  I tried to reason with her and let her know it was coming up, but strangely enough, she didn\\'t seem to believe me and just let loose!  It would be nice if there was a tiny patch of grass or gravel just outside the hotel for her to pee.  Then she could make it to the park to poop, no problem.

The hotel is old, but very well maintained and clean. The staff is friendly(ish) and unobtrusive; rooms are cleaned as if by magic! The rooms, themselves are very clean, and the beds are really comfortable, BUT, and this is a BIG but; there is NO air conditioning. In February, it was sufficient to have the sliding door open, for a bit at night, and leave the fan on high, but I, simply, cannot imagine how this room might feel in the heat of July or August. I know there is little variance in temperature, but it was quite warm in February at 18 celsius. The other HUGE issue, as I see it, is that fabulous sliding door. This door opens onto....nothing at all! We were on the eighth floor, and I just about puked when I opened the window, looked down and saw nothing but a fire escape stairwell! There are no screens on the window, so one wrong move, and it\\'s going to be quite the eye opener! This, then, is NOT the hotel for people with children, or frankly, for those who come home inebriated! Of course, one would not arrive, in one\\'s room inebriated from having visited the hotel\\'s lounge.

We were, they told us, free to hop next door, buy a bottle, ourselves, and return to enjoy it in their lounge. We hardly  made it out the door before breaking into giggles. We, needless to say, went someplace else for our glass of wine. Overall, this is a good hotel.

We chose not to take a taxi as would be expensive and we weren\\'t collecting our car until the final night due to not needing one in the city, no point it being sat in an expensive parking lot! \\n\\nThe metro takes you directly from the airport arrivals terminal into the city centre, we got off at Metro Powell Station/Downtown, walk up the stairs (there is a escalator) and you are in the heart of all of the shopping. From here you have two options to get to the hotel. \\n\\nOne: Walk up Powell Street straight past Union Square for approx. 5 blocks until you hit Sutter Street, there\\'s a Lori\\'s 24-hour Diner on the corner, look left and you will see the hotel, very easy! The walk up this road is a little steep but we managed fine with all of our luggage, in the heat, and after a 10 hour flight. \\n\\nOption two would be to catch the Cable Car, first taste of San Fran life but I can\\'t comment on if they take luggage or if it\\'s easy for you to keep hold of your belongings whilst sat on this open style car. When we arrived there was also a large queue so we didn\\'t bother. But this cable car would take you up the same road and you\\'d get off on the same corner Powell Street/Sutter Street. \\n\\nCheck-in was quick, staff were extremely cheerful and welcoming. We were immediately greeted by the door man and their expert of San Fran. This expert stood at a booth by reception and helped you find your way around, he advised us on places to eat etc and gave good advice on walking distances etc. He also sold excursions etc but never pushed them on us so we would use him just for that reason! \\nThe lobby area was clean and comfortable however further behind was dark, the bar area was empty (as in empty of anything e.g. drinks etc) so we assumed they were redecorating this maybe? The lift was small but did fit both of us and our luggage.\\n \\nWe stayed 3 nights in a Standard Double Room, I had requested a quiet room due to the road being just outside. The hall ways were narrow and very old world, old fashioned light fixtures, switches, carpet etc but I actually liked this as it made it feel as though we were in San Fran whereas staying in the mod con hotel around the corner could of made us feel as though we were anywhere in the world! \\nThe bathroom I must say was small but included everything from cotton buds to toiletries. The bed was very comfortable and the room was cool and clean. We had a large window overlooking a residential courtyard, the window slid open and you could stand on the fire escape, very New York! There was a large TV with extremely good channels. A large closet to store your luggage, we kept one in here and the other on the floor by the desk as there was so much floor space. \\nThe hotel was happy to securely store our luggage while we spent our last day out and about. \\nThis hotel is only really to sleep in, we didn\\'t see that food or room service was available. Bar area was closed. So entertainment wise you will have to go play in the city. \\n\\nLocation was excellent, just around the corner from Union Square. So many shopping opportunities and loads of food places. We did eat at Lori\\'s on the first night as we arrived so late. It was also due to there being a fire in the hotel...but that\\'s an altogether different story! We used the staff for many many questions especially walking distances, bus routes etc, all information was accurate. We walked up the road to China Town towards the Pier, made it to the Pier in maybe 30-40mins but this included stopping at a few places along the way. We took a taxi back which was good on price and no hassle at all. There is a bus stop right outside that can take you directly to the Golden Gate bridge, ask reception which bus to catch as it does change depending on the day. We got off at the Golden Gate and walked along the harbour path back to the Piers for Alcatraz. You can hire a bike instead of walking if you want to! \\n\\nPlease do note your clothing choices in San Fran, it\\'s warm around Union Sq but once you hit the harbour the wind is cold and gets colder as the night goes on. On the day we went to Alcatraz I was in a summer dress all day shopping, then changed to jeans and tshirt before going on the evening tour but was so glad I took a coat and scarf as this was essential when the night set in!  \\n\\nAnyone with walking difficulties should make use of the cable cars, I have a knee problem and after a full day walking up and down San Frans steep hills I was in agony! \\n\\nWe didn\\'t do the touristy things i.e. hop on hop off buses but these stop at Union Sq so again handy location of the hotel, however this city is easy to get around if you want to do it yourself. \\n\\nNightlife is mostly bars around the hotel, drinks area very expensive in the city centre, we went to one a few blocks away which was dueling piano players (so so so funny) and one night my partner wanted to watch the sport and so we went to the bar across the road, expected it to be a dingy bar hole but was instantly surprised! Upon walking up the stairs this was a very urban bar, buzzing with locals, had old fashioned arcade games, massive screen with multiple smaller screens dotted around, a shots wheel, many different seating areas.

Since I booked during a busy week of conferences, I already ended up paying more than $300 a night for a room. So at that price of course I would be disappointed.

And that\\'s ok because it\\'s about what you expect from a boutique hotel. The problem is that other boutique hotels around the same area offer lovely extra amenities, such as aveda hair/body products, iPod docking station for music, 5pm wine tasting or 3pm tea and scones/cookies. This hotel doesn\\'t offer any of that. Nor is there a workout facility, which is generally the case with boutiques, but with nothing else offered, just makes this a really bad value for the $. The furniture in the rooms is run-down, super old, not fashionable. The lobby fireplace is awesome, btw. but the room decor, size, amenities makes this one of the worst boutique hotels I\\'ve stayed in around Union Square in SF. If they just tried a little, it could be near the top.. Given the price and location, go stay at the Villa Florence (aveda products, iPod docking station, free wine tasting) for the same price.

But anyone sensitive to noise may want to avoid older &quot;boutique&quot; hotels and opt for the high-rise concrete properties like the Grant Hyatt or the Marriott. However if value is important and you can handle the noise, The Cartwright Hotel is one example of a great choice: super convenient but just outside the highest-traffic core where it\\'s a little too busy. Walgreens is just across the street and a famous 24-hr breakfast joint/diner is basically next door. Nob Hill, Chinatown, and the financial district are within walking distance; Japantown is a short bus ride away on the same street. The block is also excellent for ride sharing apps, unlike many other Union Square hotels where traffic is too busy / congested for the driver to pick you up. As for the room itself, the renovations are well-done but expect to feel cramped as the rooms are tiny. The walls are thin too so again, beware if you\\'re sensitive to banging doors and loud people. If you have a workaround though (e.g. earplugs, noise cancelling earphones, or a Bluetooth speaker playing white noise) and you get a room in the back of the hotel, then this hotel is a pretty good choice given the relatively expensive area.",4,positive

The place was very conveniently located. Right near Union Square, many restaurants, a cable car stop, and the Center itself, it seemed that most things were in reach. \\nThe room itself was clean (but very small). As long as you understand that this is meant to be a place to base yourself and to spend most of it out the room, it is fairly good. Not big on amenities; there is an instant coffee machine, and a tv in the rooms; mornings downstairs there is coffee, etc, at the nice lounge area with sofas and a fireplace! But other than that, meals must be sought elsewhere. Now: I stayed in the 2nd floor (that is, 1 up from ground), so street noise did filter in at night. No view at all (brick wall out the window); but, although this is no criticism of the hotel, I found the night-noises difficult to get used to; either, banging buses, homeless people, construction, and odd sirens and things- I found noise cancelling earphones very useful. The economic gap in SF (and probably America in general) is much, much larger than Australia; there are homeless on every street corner with little support (and recall- in winter when I visited, there can be a homeless-population migration to California from other states); and there was also unfortunately a spate of armed jewellery robberies during the stay- on occurring only a few shops down from the hotel; but I think this is unusual. The weather at this time of year was warmer than I expected, around 20 C most of the time with sunny alternating with cloud/rain. Overall I rate this hotel fairly good for what it claims to be.

All that said, they are really doing the best with what they have. The king size bed was very comfortable and the room was far from the street and very quiet. The staff could not have been more friendly or helpful. The common area is lovely but they only have coffee and tea in the morning. The restaurant nearby is $12-15 for breakfast. It is right in the heart of Union Square and a great location. Perhaps if we hadn\\'t been 2 people and staying so long it would have been fine.

When we asked for restaurant recommendations or directions, they were always helpful.

Always had plenty of hot water, shower pressure, clean towels and I thought the bed was very comfy for a hotel bed, so I was happy. Oh, and the large flat panel TV was nice, too.\\n\\nThe location is very close to all of the Union Square shopping and general toursity atmosphere. About a 5-10 minute walk to the BART/MUNI. There IS a Starbucks right off the lobby, which was convenient, but I thought the service there was subpar.

A few blocks away there is a great Thai place called Arroi and a sushi place called Sanraku. Also liked the diner across the street and down a block for French Toast and walk a few blocks to get to a great French place called Plouf (mussels and clams galore).

Whether you\\'re paying $500 for a luxery hotel or $100 for the Diva, you\\'re going to run into panhandlers in SF.

I looked at all the pictures and decided to choose Hotel Diva.\\nThe day before we were to arrive, I received an email to upgrade our room for a fee. I decided to try for the upgrade since I knew the rooms were small.\\nThe hotel is about 30 minutes from the airport. The check in process was very easy and quick. I am glad we received an upgrade (for a fee), but the extra room was much needed for my husband and I to not feel like we were standing on top of each other.\\nThe rooms could use paint and updating and the bathrooms could use a vented fan. The walls are thin, you can hear people talking in their rooms and the hallway has a musty smell.  We did unfortunately have a terrible view, but it is what it is. The rooms were always cleaned when we returned to our room. The hotel fee is a bit much for what you receive. The fitness center was good- there are free weights and a few pieces of cardio machines. The business center was used once to print our boarding passes and we never took advantage of the champagne toast. We did appreciate the filtered water station! The fee is a bit much for what you receive.\\nThe location is ideal; Starbucks is right next door- you don\\'t even have to walk outside! There is a great Mexican restaurant on the other side of the hotel- we went for brunch and dinner...it did not disappoint.  There is so much shopping right up the street from the hotel.\\nThe rooms are small and outdated, but the location is great and the hotel should not make or break a vacation.",3,negative

Not sure what some folks think when they book a room in the middle of a fairly large city.  I expected the rooms to be small, I expected city noise, I expected to encounter all kinds of people, including the homeless.  What I found at the Hotel Diva was a decent-sized room (which they graciously upgraded for me), not  much noise (the only noise I heard was an occasional door-slamming), and some homeless folks that were actually quite friendly and totally harmless.  The staff was top-notch - everyone we encountered from the manager to the cleaning staff couldn\\'t do enough to make our stay enjoyable.  \\n\\nThe room was very IKEA-like - slick and efficient.  Plenty of room for two.  I liked the fact that the sink was located separately from the bathroom which made it quick and easy for two of us to get ready for the day.  Plus, the room was spotless!  We were upgraded to the 7th floor, which included a lovely continental breakfast each morning with coffee that rivaled Starbucks (which was right next door, by the way).\\n\\nAs someone else commented, the lobby wasn\\'t much to speak of but who spends time in the lobby?  It was small, but sleek with a concierge that was pleasant and very helpful.  If it weren\\'t for him we might have missed our day trip to Yosemite.  The tour company for some reason had our name wrong on their list, but the concierge ran out and caught up with the driver and got it straightened out - and we didn\\'t even book the trip through him.  Definitely take advantage of the wonderful (and free) wine reception offered in the lobby a few nights during the week (I think its Tues through Thurs from 4pm-6pm).\\n\\nLet\\'s talk location.  You can\\'t beat the location of the Diva.  It\\'s in Union Square, blocks from public trans that can get you anywhere in the city.  We didn\\'t need a car, and at $35 a night for parking and gas at $4.09 a gallon, public trans is a blessing and a bargain.  We took BART from the airport ($5.25) to Powell St. and walked to the hotel, with luggage in tow.  No major hills from Powell to Geary - about a 5-block walk.  Get yourself a 1- or 3-day Muni pass and take the subway, bus, trolley or cable car anywhere in the city - all right there from Powell St.  You\\'re within walking distance to restaurants, shops, nightclubs and theaters.  We walked to Chinatown one evening for dinner - not a bad walk at all, no major hills involved.  \\n\\nHonestly, we didn\\'t have one bad thing to say about this hotel.

While it did have some modernistic styles to it, some of that was just plain weird and made the place feel cold.  Neon blue lights in the elevators and metal sinks that made you feel like you were washing up in a garbage disposal!  We were first given a &quot;Two Room Studio Queen&quot; and while the main room was fine, the one with the murphy bed was stark and creepy.  I pulled down the murphy bed which had a thin sheet on it, not comphy blanket or pillow like the other bed.  I asked housekeeping for towels and to make up the murphy bed and when we returned from our evening out, the towels were there on the unmade bed.  I called again and the &quot;housekeeping&quot; but really a guy who looked like a maintenance man arrived and said &quot;what would you like me to do?&quot; with a snarky tone.  He pointed me to a closet w/pillows and a blanket.  Excuse me, didn\\'t realize I had to make my own bed at a hotel.  I turned on the flatscreen and it was all snowy w/terrible reception.  Off to a good start.  The second night we switched to a regular room w/two queen sized beds.  They told us which room to go to.  Later we found the bathroom was not cleaned (you don\\'t want to know...) as well as garbage left by previous guests.  That TV also was difficult to see and the clock we were given was set on a completely wrong time and the ipod plug in didnt work.  Speaking of my ipod (ipad) while there was free wi-fi, it was terrible and barely worked.  I\\'m guessing they did clean the room the following nights b/c of the housekeeping knocks on the door while we were still sleeping in the morning.  They may want to consider those little &quot;please do not disturb&quot; door hangers to solve that problem.  To top it all off, there is an alley alongside the hotel that every night at about 3am bottle pick woke us up and kept us up as loud crashing noises filled our room!

It\\'s kind of tucked away (at least the ground floor rooms are) and that made for very pleasant sleeping. I\\'ve stayed at many other downtown hotels where I had to wear earplugs to block out the honking and yelling and all the other noises of downtown.\\n\\nThe internet is really fast. I clocked it about 10mb/s down and up. And it was very reliable, too.\\n\\nThe rooms are newly renovated with very comfortable beds, and a lot of space overall for a downtown hotel room.\\n\\nThe service were always very friendly.\\n\\nNow the bad stuff:\\n\\nThe bathroom was a like a bad, cruel joke. \\nThe hot water came on when it felt like it and turned off again just as easily. I frequently waited over ten minutes (I timed it) for the hot water to come on. Just standing there, naked and freezing, until it was finally warm enough to shower. At other times (usually right when I was about to call the front desk to complain) it came on instantly. One time I was in the middle of a shower and the hot water mostly went away (the water wasn\\'t freezing, but it wasn\\'t warm enough, either) for about 5 minutes, then came back even though I hadn\\'t touched the faucet.\\nIf that wasn\\'t bad enough, there no shelves in the shower! So I just had to leave all my stuff (shampoo, conditioner, razor, etc.) lying on the floor of the shower. Oh, and to top it all off, there wasn\\'t a shower door, either - only half of the shower had a wall, so the other half let water out all over the floor. I almost forgot: another dumb thing about the bathroom: the light is on a motion sensor, which is a good idea generally, except in the middle of the night when I stumbled in and was blinded when all the lights came on.\\n\\nOne day, they decided to test the alarm system at 10:30am, right when I was in the middle of trying to get some work done. They tested it over and over, and it was painfully loud and jarring. Also, I told the front desk I was going to use the gym (which is a few blocks away, but is actually really nice - it\\'s called Active Sports Club and they have great equipment, free weights, squat rack, smith bar, and even a pool) and he told me all I needed to bring was my hotel key. That was wrong - you also need your ID - so I had to come back to get that.\\n\\nSomething that didn\\'t bother me, but it might matter to other people: the TV guide shows a whole bunch of channels, but they only actually offer the over-the-air broadcast channels. There are a few other random things that are annoying but I assume they\\'ll fix. For example, they told me I could get free water from a dispenser (the water in the room is $3 per bottle!!) but the dispenser was broken, so I had to find water at the conference I was going to. Also, they have temporary signs up with the room numbers which also have brail, but since it\\'s printed, the brail is completely useless. It just feels very poorly managed and not well thought out.\\n\\nAll things considered, the bad far outweigh the good, at least for now. If they fix the bathrooms and complete the renovation, it might be a pretty good option. But for now, at the prices they\\'re charging, you can do much better.",3,negative

OUT/com/60713/112303/639280275.html,Hotel Diva,"""My first stay at Hotel Diva in 2017 was in room 212, and was great.  Last week, I was there for five nights, and it was a completely different experience, except that the bed in the 6th floor room I had was as comfortable as in 212.  That is where the similarities stopped.  I requested a lower floor room on my reservation, preferably on the 2nd floor away from the street.  I was told when I mentioned this at check in that because I booked through American Airlines they could put me where ever they wanted. So, I entered the elevator and it creaked toward the 6th floor.  I did appreciate being put toward the back of the hotel, away from the street, I reminded myself as I walked down corridors with walls that were scraped and scratched and in my opinion really needed a coat of paint.  The first of the two keys I received on check in didn\\'t work.  Thank goodness the second key worked. Once settled, I turned on the TV, but the remote then didn\\'t work to turn the channels.  I thought that perhaps the batteries needed moving, so I turned over the remote, only to find that there was duct tape where there should have been a cover over the batteries.  Sigh. I pulled back the duct tape and wiggled that batteries, but that didn\\'t work.  I called the front desk and the person who answered said they could fix the remote and would be right up.  After 90 minutes with no one in sight and no call, I go ready for bed.  The person then called and said he was sorry but he\\'d gotten busy.  Because I couldn\\'t turn the TV off without the remote, I had to unplug the TV from the wall socket.  When I did that, the socket wasn\\'t affixed to the wall and almost came out completely from the wall.  After working a long day, I returned to my room that evening and had a new remote, thank goodness, that if I held in just the right position would work with the TV.  During the night, I kept hearing a noise that at first I thought was rain, but then as I awakened more, realized it was not coming from the direction of the window, but the floor.  I used my phone to lighten the floor and saw a bag I sat on the floor the night before had moved.  When I poke it with my phone, a mouse came running out.  It ran under the desk near the bed.  After lying awake for the next few hours, I left for work, stopping by the front desk to discretely tell the front desk clerk that there was a mouse in my room.  While he offered to have me move, I really didn\\'t have time to go back up and pack everything for the week up and move because of meetings.  The ops manager sent me an email offering to give me a certificate toward two nights\\' of a future stay.  I respectfully declined. Between the duct taped broken remote, clanky elevator, scratched walls, unsafe (in my opinion) plug and mouse, I believe I will stay somewhere else while in San Francisco next month.",1,negative

The cool lighting in the stylish elevator made up for this and sets a good vibe. I must say however the elevated thresholds are not exactly baggage cart friendly. \\nOur room consisted of a desk, a dresser, a closet (with safe) , a bathroom , and a large bed in a room that was clean, nicely organized and had a fashionista metallic theme going. The headboard on bed stretched to the ceiling and peeled apart at the top as if it where the back of a tight fitting corset. The bed was very comfortable and the ample pillows were soft. The rooms are somewhat dimly lit but the halogen swing out bedside lights provided extra light if needed. The carpet while dark appeared clean and was not an issue. \\nThe bathroom was very small. The toilet, sink and bathtub consumed the space without an inch to spare, but the shower was very good with excellent water pressure. For us it was fine , the toilet was clean had good flush and the sink was wide with decent storage below for toiletries. There were ample fresh white towels , but they did smell a bit of chlorine bleach when wet.

The cleaning staff did a fine job and replaced the towels as requested. \\nWe are nonsmokers so I must gripe about waking up to the smell of smoke in the morning.

I HEARD vacuums in the hotel, just not sure what they had been cleaning - since it clearly wasn\\'t the floor.  The room was small, which is expected in an older building, I was fine with that. The bathroom too - was small, as to be expected as well. Overall the room appeared to be decorated in some odd 90\\'s modern themed - with faux brushed metal, blue carpet, gun metal grey walls, some odd dead flower art hanging from the walls and strange cheap adjustable lamps that never stayed in place - they kept drooping down. The room was also accompanied by a dorm room metal filing cabinet type dresser, as well as a dorm room type mini fridge. Don\\'t even bother with the TV because a) your in San Fran - go explore and b) the reception is awful. \\n\\nThe bathroom was tiny, but manageable. The lighting was based on a timed turn switch, so it was frustrating trying to keep the lights on on the bathroom. the faucet handles were also very 90\\'s modern pointless functional furnishing looking... please just use hot and cold easy to use knobs people!\\n\\nI\\'d have to say the business centers and the lobby are the nicest decorated places in the building, it\\'s a shame you can\\'t stay there! \\n\\nOverall the hotel is a decent deal for your money if you\\'re looking for a place to store your bags and sleep. It is by no means a chic/luxury hotel. The location is amazing, and can\\'t be beat really. The desk attendants were also very nice.\\nOur main gripe however was the valet service. All week our car had been pulled around at a timely fashion. Until it was the day to go to the airport. It took them a whopping 60 minutes to pull our car around, making us late to the airport. \\n\\nSo if you\\'re looking for a cheap/semi clean/good local hotel - this is your place.",3,negative

The price through their &quot;Cheap is Chic&quot; special on their website was $109, which can\\'t be beat for the central location.  \\n\\nTHE GOOD: Cheap!!  Great Location!!  It\\'s within walking distance to everything around Union Square-  The square itself, the shopping, the theatres (it\\'s right across the street from one), restaurants, the Market-Powell Cable Car line (takes you to Fisherman\\'s Wharf for $5/one way), Chinatown, Civic Center, Nob Hill, etc.  There\\'s a drugstore (it was either a Walgreens or Eckerds) about a block or less away which is convenient and there\\'s a Starbucks right next door.  There\\'s also a Borders bookstore several blocks away, about a 6 minute walk.  The decor was great (although I did overhear an older couple complaining about how it was &quot;too modern&quot;).  It\\'s decorated in greys, blues, with punches of orange and a lot of metal (the furniture and &quot;headboard&quot;) (you can check it out on the website).  The room and bathroom were both super clean and well equipped.  There are a selection of magazines (NYLON, a local fashion magazine, etc.), the toiletries smell amazing, and there\\'s a cute little welcome bag with freebies and goodies in there like emergen-C, toothpaste, an energy drink sample, Nivea face body cream, etc.  There\\'s also a distinct &quot;DIVA!&quot; theme or &quot;personality&quot; (as they call it) throughout your stay, which may strike some as being over the top and definitely oriented to a young, hip, female crowd.  (I thought it was fun and a welcome change from stuffier hotels but my fiance definitely rolled his eyes a couple times).  There\\'s a small desk and chair, a comfy bed (super smooth sheets), a dresser (it looks like a lateral file cabinet) and the tv is wall-mounted (like in a hospital).  There\\'s an iron and ironing board, safe, and full-length mirror in the closet.  The bathroom also had really nice modern fixtures.  There are &quot;offices&quot; on several floors with a computer and internet access (but no printer).  There is also AIR CONDITIONING!!  A lot of places in San Francisco don\\'t have air conditioning since it\\'s usually pretty cool but it\\'s nice for the rare &quot;heat wave&quot; like the one they had recently.  The service is incredible!  The concierge was helpful for arranging our transportation to the airport, as well as fielding our questions about the area.\\n\\nTHE &quot;BAD&quot;: Note, most of these observations aren\\'t unique to The Diva since they pretty much apply to any of the boutique hotels in the area.  The rooms are small, but any decent hotel in the Union Square area at this price will be small-  Even then, it\\'s only really small if there are two people staying in the room.  And the decor more than makes up for it.  I would rather stay at a nice, clean, modern place than get a larger room in a depressing motel-ish place.  Try to get a room away from the street-  Our room faced Geary Street and it gets pretty loud at night.  Turning on the air conditioning / fan helped mask the noise and it didn\\'t bother my fiance but I slept with earplugs.  (It didn\\'t bother me enough to ask for a different room).  There\\'s no minifridge and the cable TV options were pretty poor (although, again, you\\'re probably not in Union Square to sit around, eating from your minifridge, and watching a lot of TV!  The one thing that was kind of annoying was how dark it was since the lamps weren\\'t that strong.\\n\\nThe location is perfectly safe-  There are a lot of affluent shops around Union Square so people forget that San Francisco has a huge, HUGE homeless population and a huge, HUGE drug problem.  And that it\\'s a pretty dirty city (like NYC dirty but better since there aren\\'t as many people).  You may smell the distinct odor of pee on one street and then you\\'ll be standing in front of a swanky shop.  You\\'re going to be aware of people asking you for change, food, etc.   It\\'s not like you\\'re on the streets of Calcutta, but you\\'ll pretty much see a homeless person or junky on every street.  Occasionally, someone might start going crazy and yelling at someone or no one in particular on the street (this happened to me).  But there are tons of people out and about (due to the theatre-goers and restaurants and bars) so we felt comfortable, even relatively late at night.  Most of the hotels lining Geary street have 24-hour doormen or people at the front desk, which gives you the comforting sense that there are at least several eyes and ears open at all times to the street.  \\n\\nWho Will Not Enjoy Union Square / The Diva Hotel: If you are looking for quaint, warm, or traditional, you probably won\\'t like The Diva since you may feel the decor at the hotel is too industrial or &quot;cold&quot; and modern.  And on a delicate note...If you\\'re part of an &quot;older crowd&quot; used to staying at large established chain hotels, you may not like The Diva since it definitely has an almost aggressively youthful &quot;tone&quot; which can be interpreted as fun, or annoying, depending on your point of view.  Also, like my fiance\\'s parents, if you\\'re going to be uncomfortable staying in an area that is vibrant and centrally located but definitely urban and somewhat seedy looking on some streets and with a population of homeless people and drug addicts, then stay at the hermetically sealed (and very nice but expensive) Westin in the area, or at one of the nice hotels on bucolic Nob Hill (trust me, no panhandlers will be trekking up those ridiculously steep hills).  \\n\\nWe also stayed at the Savoy (and ate at the Millenium for about 5 days, leaving with thinner wallets and fatter waistlines) and wrote a review of those on Tripadvisor as well if you\\'re interested!\\n\\nHave a great time in San Francisco!\\n",5,positive

Location couldn\\'t get much better right off Union square and the hub for everything you could need for a stay in San Fran. Easy walk to Westfield and all public transport links. The hotel was quite quirky and untraditional but was always clean and well presented. Room wasn\\'t the biggest but we did have a huge very comfortable bed. Don\\'t think you can expect large rooms in the centre of San Fran and was bigger than the room I had at the Handelery hotel where I stayed in 2006. Shower was powerful and never any problems with hot water. Lovely toiletries supplied daily if they were used and housekeeping did a great job of keeping the room clean and tidy. Reception staff were always very welcoming and helpful. The Starbucks downstairs is a great addition and open early and late. Best tip I can give anyone is to get a muni pass for public transport. Covers cable cars, trams street cars and busses. The cable car is great fun but not the quickest way to get around  often with very long queues. Don\\'t get on at the turning point at the bottom of Powell street always a very long wait try and catch it at the crossing of Geary and Powell right down from the hotel. The cable cars only fully fill 1 in 3 at the turning point so leave space for stops after and there\\'s never more than a few people waiting. The best transport to use to get between union square and fisherman\\'s wharf is the F line street cars which pick up right outside Westfield. These run all the way to the wharf with stops at all the major at attraction piers, including the ferry building and pier 33 for Alcatraz. Would definitely stay at the diva again for the location alone. ",4,positive

But when I went to take my own bags out of the car, the same concierge from the first trip came out of the hotel, looked at my wallet, looked at me, looked at my wallet again and nodded to the valet, as if demanding a tip.  So fine, I tipped the valet.  At which point the concierge actually went up to the valet to see what I tipped him.  Maybe you had to be there to witness that, but it was a bit presumptuous to say the lease.\\n\\nSo, my concierge, I tipped the valet (which I would have done anyway).

The hotel resides in an old building so you get what comes along with that...  Small, shaky elevators, narrow halls, and uneven floors.  But it is very boutique-y and decorated very fashionably.  The room was an okay size - not huge but not tiny either.  The bathroom sink is more in the bedroom rather than the bathroom.  Our friends who stayed in a different room were not as fortunate - their sink was in the bathroom, and unfortunately, one of them took a nasty hit to the head from the sink when bending over.\\n\\nBy far the worst thing I can say about the hotel is the valet parking.  There\\'s not much space in front of the hotel when you are checking in, and they pretty much warn you that you could get towed while waiting for valet to park your car.  Don\\'t need that stress - and they are even aware of it and have no solution.  But much worse than that is when you want to leave and have to wait for the valet to bring your car back.  The wait is ridiculously long.  We waited for over an hour.  Fortunately we live within driving distance and didn\\'t have to worry about catching a plane.  Otherwise it could have been a disaster.  They offered nothing in return for the wait and no explanation.  They did give me a few chocolates though for our trouble.  Seriously?  It would have been nice to have received free parking or even a free night.\\n\\nWould I stay here again?  Yes, because it is close to everything and the hotel itself is a bargain.

My husband and I arrived well before the appointed check-in time, and were very pleased to find out they could check us in (we figured we would just store our bags, so this was very nice). The room, however, was extremely small (shoe-box size, no room even to put our very small travel bags so we could open them) and smelled VERY musty. The bathroom was tiny and poorly designed  (tub/shower combo and toilet in the bathroom, while the sink was in the hotel room itself -- kind of gross in our opinion). The bed was very small (a double?) but we had reserved a queen. When it became clear that opening the windows was clearly not helping the musty smell, we decided to complain, as we were staying for 5 nights, and our rate was quite pricey (approx. $250/night). The gentleman at the desk was quite receptive to our complaints (his name was Jay) and he offered to move us the following day and to send up someone to febreeze the room. This helped a bit with the odor, but we were told this happens a lot in the back rooms of the hotel when it rains (and it rains a lot in San Francisco -- so beware these rooms!). True to his word, Jay did indeed  move us the following day to a more spacious, better designed and clean smelling room. I felt very pleased with the solution and felt the hotel took our complaints seriously. \\nAll in all, not a bad hotel, but nothing special.

OUT/com/60713/112303/89951842.html,Hotel Diva,"""I\\'ve stayed at the Hotel Diva maybe five times over the past five years.  I\\'ve also stayed at at least a dozen other hotels in the area, because I travel on business to San Francisco regularly and am always on the lookout for a good property that I can go back to.  I stayed at the Diva most recently because the price was very competitive, but I doubt I\\'ll stay there again.\\n\\nThe Diva is a couple of blocks from Union Square, and is near shopping and many restaurants.  The area is safe and relatively clean.  The lobby is small; you wouldn\\'t want to sit and read a newspaper or have  a drink or chat with friends--it\\'s strictly for checking in and out.  There\\'s a small business center and exercise room, and free wi-fi in the rooms.  All good.  \\n\\nThe problem for me is (1) the size of the rooms, and (2) the decor, or lack thereof.  This last stay, I was in a square white box containing a bed, a thin desk, and a small end table on either side of the bed.  There was no room for anything else.  The bathroom was just large enough for a tub, sink and toilet.  One window, overlooking a fire escape and very narrow alley, such that you wouldn\\'t want to look out of the window, which let in little light. A flat-screen TV attached to the wall, which swings out for viewing from the bed--there\\'s no other place to view it from.  Behind the bed, there was a large flat piece of steel bolted to the wall, which seems to be standard in every room.\\n\\nI felt like I was in prison.  I don\\'t tend to spend much time in my room--I use it for sleeping and not much else--but it still felt claustrophobic.  Although the Diva seems to present itself as new and arty, there\\'s actually very little art work anywhere; it\\'s quite spartan The steel on the wall is not, in my mind, an appealing feature. It lacks both warmth and anything to distract attention from the bare white walls.\\n\\nI was awakened in the wee hours by lots of banging on trash cans from the alley.  This is not uncommon for hotels in the area, but some have double windows to better block the noise.\\n\\nThere\\'s nothing wrong with a reliably clean, well-located box--if it\\'s priced at the bottom of the scale for the area.  The Diva is not pricey, but it\\'s pricey for what you get, and it\\'s a mystery to me.  There being so many hotels within a few blocks, I don\\'t find the Diva competitive at its price point, since it offers me absolutely nothing beyond its good location.  For about the same price I can find a similar location, a larger room, some attempt at decor, and maybe a wine tasting in the evening, and/or a lobby that\\'s hospitable.  I have a friend who stays at the Diva religiously because she likes the work-out room.  There\\'s that, but it\\'s by no means the only place around that either has a health club or access to one nearby.",3,negative

The floors are not level, by any stretch of the imagination, nor are they quiet. Half of the computer stations were down as well. Other than being right down the street from where we needed to be, having a Starbucks connected, and getting an extremely good deal on it, I would not reccomend this to anyone who is even slightly picky about where they stay.

We highly, highly recommend the Diva, and we had a great time.\\n\\nWe stayed in a studio suite queen, which provided us 2 separate bedrooms that shared a bathroom, this was perfect for us.  Complaints about noise on Geary street are valid, ask for a room in the back.  The individual that checked us in gave us a choice and we did this, and the room was quiet.\\n\\nOur beds were comfortable.  Our rooms weren\\'t big, but weren\\'t tiny either.   We did fine with a week\\'s worth of clothes as long as we were organized.  Our bedrooms and bathroom were very clean and stayed that way throughout the week.  Note to visitors, tip cleaning staff at any hotel a few dollars a day, this always goes a long way.\\n\\nThe staff were sociable and helpful 100% of the time, including cleaning staff,  and several staff members made it a point to be engaging to my children.   My kids weren\\'t ignored and were treated well.  I greatly appreciated this.  The hotel does appear to be marketed to adults, but my kids fit in fine and we did not feel out of place.  I noticed they have many specials, several geared towards kids  The lounges were great, I liked the style and appreciated having computers and morning coffee available.\\n\\nAre there homeless outside, yes, and they are all over San Francisco as well.  While I don\\'t care for being hit up for money every 5 minutes, neither was I harassed, and one homeless gentleman even directed my daughter towards the inner sidewalk when she was unsafely heading towards the street.  Polite homeless folk?  Only in San Francisco!\\n\\nI truly don\\'t understand some of the negative reviews on this site.  I\\'ve traveled a lot.  Was our experience perfect?  Well, I found a piece of lint once, and the screen saver on the computer in the internet lounge jammed up from time to time.  Twice the coffee in the lounge came a little later than I wanted (I was on NY time and was up between 4-5am most mornings)  So what?  Any complaints I might have are minor in comparison to the major issues  I\\'ve experienced at other hotels.  You want perfection and someone to jump when something minor bothers you?  Pay 5 times as much and go to an expensive chain hotel.   Stay in NYC sometime and you\\'ll see what I mean.   Our experience at the Diva was much, much better than average and I would happily stay here again, with my family or on my own.  It was a great experience and a great value.\\n\\nDcman",5,positive

OUT/com/60713/112303/602775240.html,Hotel Diva,"""The ads for this hotel imply super-modern and new rooms but in fact is quite a tired old place. The elevators are old and slow, the a/c unit in the room is one of those devices with a few buttons and a very noisy blower and is positioned right beside the bed so you cannot escape the sound of the direct blowing air at night. The bathroom is ok, nothing special, but the washroom area is outside the bathroom and open to the rest of the room so if you like privacy in your grooming this is not the place for you. The hotel staff is friendly but it took three days (out of seven) to get room care that included enough towels, face cloths, etc. for two people and to get the air vent in the bathroom cleaned, which obviously had not happened for a very long time. There is a Keurig coffee/tea machine but no fridge or microwave. There were two large windows in the room but both looked out on similar windows of other rooms in the hotel, so you need to keep the shades drawn all the time if you want privacy. Electrical outlets are sparse for two people with digital devices. The hotel is obviously doing good tourist business judging by the crowded lobby. Outside, the neighborhood is a combination of packs of tourists and large numbers of homeless people, mostly men, begging money, wrapped in quilts on the sidewalk or in closed doorways at night. It doesn\\'t seem dangerous, but it is unpleasant, certainly. We gave them our leftover food from restaurants and my old coat after I bought a new one because the weather was so chilly during our week. Would I recommend this hotel to other people? No, not really. It was expensive considering what you get for your money. I can say that on the sixth floor at the dead end of side hallway, our room was very quiet.

Overall the staff were great in terms of giving me directions around the area and arranging transportation to San Francisco airport. \\nThe Hotel is in a good location, near the shopping and theaters in Union Square and around 4 blocks from the BART. However, the area right around the Hotel is a bit seedy and not too attractive to wander around at night. \\nThe room was clean and did not have any problems with smell or inoperative bathroom fixtures as noted in some previous reviews. However the room I had was quite small, OK for 1 person but it would have been a tight squeeze for 2. More importantly, the hotel had a higher noise level than that found in more modern buildings. I could easily hear conversations in other rooms. More problematic was the noise from the garbage trucks early in the morning, Perhaps a room on a higher floor (I was on the second) would be better. \\nThe free internet worked well and the internet lounges were attractive. There is free coffee from 7-10AM in one of the lounges. This is nice, but coffee the rest if the day of some fruit or pastries in the morning would have been a nice touch.  There is a Starbucks next store, but the line can be long so having better access to coffee would be nice for those in a hurry. \\nOveall, this is an OK place to stay if you like this type of hotel and recognize the limitations.",4,positive

The lack of sound proofing really exaggerated this unfortunate issue.

OUT/com/60713/112303/515124033.html,Hotel Diva,"""Our stay at the Diva was disappointing to say the least. We were given an upgrade due to my husband and myself celebrating a special occasion and i asked that if possible could we have a room with a good view of the city. We were thrilled until we opened the door to our room. The room had blinds that were closed which had pictures on them  but when we opened them to look at our view all we saw was approx 2 to 3 metres away, a wall of Windows 7 stories high exposing more rooms in the hotel. If we looked to the left and right we saw nothing but concrete walls and windows. This meant that not only did we have no view but unless we wanted other guests looking in on our every move we had to keep our blinds closed and our lights on in our room the entire 5 nights we were there. Not only this but the whole hotel is describe as updated!!!!....if you throw some paint on some old rough unprepared walls and put some cheap carpet on the floor it doesn\\'t mean it\\'s updated. The owners of the Diva have tried to make a silk purse out of a sows ear and it can\\'t be done. Dark grey paint which is flaking off all over the place and floors that dip up and down so much they are like a rollercoaster are yet another strike against this property. We got the feeling this used to be either an old brothel or a backpackers due to the rabbit warren style of the cross over corridors.  Every night we stayed at the Diva we were woken up by something. The Windows are so thin and don\\'t close properly so you can not only see right into the adjacent rooms but you can hear what they\\'re arguing about at 4am. The noise from the air conditioning unit dripping intermitently throughout the night wakes you up and ( in our case) when the person in the room above gets up every morning at 6.30am you hear every step they make and every time they have a shower or flush the toilet.\\nFrom the rust over the elevators doors to the beggars and homeless approaching as soon as you step outside the hotel the Diva dissapointed us. Their only saving grace was the excellent staff that were very professional and helpful. Unfortunately though this wasn\\'t enough for us to over look everything else that let this hotel down. In fact when the Uber driver dropped us off in front of the Diva he joked with us and said this block of town was so sketchy after dark the Uber drivers nick named it Zombie Town. We both agreed after our first night walking back to our room. If this were a budget hotel I could over look most of this but The Diva Hotel charges prices that you would expect from a far more respected establishment which this most definitely isn\\'t. They even advertise they have free shots in the lobby every night but what they fail to tel you is this is just a man crammed in the corner with a trolley with shots on that you are allocated only one each while stand in the very small lobby trying to avoid other patrons. They tried but definitely missed with this selling point. I advise you to spend your hard earned money in a hotel that actually has the vanity in the bathroom not in the bedroom because it can\\'t fit in the pokey bathroom or go to a far cheaper place and get the same quality hotel you get here.

The concierge at the front desk told me that there were only first-floor room available since it was late, and most guests had already checked in and I could switch the next day if I want a room higher up.  I actually did not mind, as I had not even given that a thought and I ended up not even switching rooms. My room was tucked away in the back, there are double blinds for you to manually crank if you want more/less privacy, no view- wasn\\u2019t a big deal to me, there was still light beaming through in the daytime. My room was right across from the 24-hour gym (decent variety of workout machines and weights), again was not a big issue, I did not hear anyone working out.

You would think a hotel with &quot;Diva&quot; in the name would have easy closet access.\\n- The TV is on a loose arm which causes the TV to droop to the side\\n- The shower takes a long while to get hot\\n- The bottles of water in your room are $3.50 each.

Extra points for that! The front-desk staff are young, enthusiastic and helpful.

Not cool That said, I decided to use both apparent \\'drawbacks\\' to my advantage (they cancelled each other out!): I did find that the lower I set the room temperature, the louder the A/C was. It drowned out about 80% of the street noise using \\'white noise\\', which worked to my advantage. Would I stay there again? ABSOLUTELY. Loved the location and the proximity to the places I wanted to go, &amp; the things I wanted to see.

The bathroom was not huge but had absolutely everything that I needed. \\n\\nThe most amazing thing though was the bed and the bed linen. I could hardly drag myself away from it in the mornings and looked forward to coming back to it at night!\\n\\nI was in a front-facing room with two large windows. As it\\'s an old building and the windows are not double-glazed, there is quite a lot of noise from the road. This only becomes annoying at a weekend evening when there are a few night clubs around and shrieking people at 2am, or when the protests outside Hotel Frank are going on, generally during the day but sometimes as early as 8am (you can check their website for details of protest times).

OUT/com/60713/112303/489138594.html,Hotel Diva,"""Hotel Diva does the trick; meaning, it provides affordable lodging in a pretty centralized location, with a friendly and helpful staff. The buck runs out there \\u2013 so \\u2013 as other reviewers mentioned \\u2013 you may not find this hotel too desirable if you fancy luxurious accommodations with a lot of bells and whistles. If you\\u2019re just looking for a \\u201chome base\\u201d and don\\u2019t care about extras, then this is for you. I fall into the latter category, and my visit was a good one. Here\\u2019s a list of pros and cons:\\n\\nPros:\\nAffordable \\u2013 Most of the hotels in Union Square run NYC rates, so $300+/night. Keep in mind, though, the hotel charges an ABSURD $15/night fee, which includes your wifi and access to a sub-par business center.\\n\\nCentral \\u2013 Union Square is a great place to be centrally located to all of the major tourist attractions.\\n\\nComfortable \\u2013 The bed and linens are top notch. You\\u2019ll get a good night\\u2019s rest here.\\n\\nAccess \\u2013 Starbucks abuts the property, which is welcoming to coffee drinkers. The Pine Crest Diner, one of SF\\u2019s best, is located across the street. Several sushi joints are just a block away.\\n\\nAirport Shuttle \\u2013 For $15/person, there is a van that will pick you up and take you to SFO when you check-out. I used BART to get to the hotel when I arrived, but I had to leave very early for a flight and I did not want to walk around or navigate public transit so early (see my notes below).\\n\\nCons:\\nThe elevators are sketch. Take the stairs. Seriously.\\n\\nThe bathroom is very small, and the sink is not in the bathroom, which is annoying. I\\u2019m not sure if this is true of all rooms, but it was of mine. A plus, though: the shower has great water pressure. \\n\\nThis one is important: Be careful walking around at night. San Francisco has a serious homelessness problem, but what\\u2019s different from other cities, is here the homeless are aggressive, and they hang in this area. They will ask you for money and if you make eye contact they will follow you and yell. This is most uninviting. Union Square is well patrolled, but the infamous Tenderloin District is just two streets over and down, and that is a completely different story. I learned this the hard way when heading to the Orpheum Theater. I offer this as a \\u201ccon\\u201d because the hotel staff brushed it off as no big deal. I live in Boston \\u2013 a huge city with problems of its own \\u2013 and frequent NYC; I\\u2019ve never seen a place so inundated with the kind of homelessness that makes you question your safety. Word of the wise, take an Uber back to the hotel after 9PM. \\n\\nOverall \\u2013 Hotel Diva is a good solution when you just need a bed. With all there\\u2019s to see and do in San Francisco, you\\u2019ll be glad you did not waste prime dollar on a place you\\u2019ll just need to sleep.

When I studied the hotel reviews prior to deciding on Diva I found most if not all Poor or terrible ratings were actually quite pathetic and a number by people full of their own self importance.\\n\\nI requested an Executive Room for my partner and I just for extra room and found this to be perfect. I wanted a room facing the street not a alleyway or building wall and near the top floor. We got a room on the top floor which is the 7th. The Executive rooms a spacious, modern and had a  lounge suite which could have been folded out for a third bed.\\n\\nFor us the much talked about lifts (2) worked the whole time and not an issue.\\n\\nFront Office/Receptoin staff were very helpul and pleasant.\\n\\nHousekeeping and daily room servicing was very good. Very Very comfy beds.\\n\\nThe thing that prospective guests need to decide is that although this hotel is not the subject of any protest, the Hotel Frank, which is about 100mtrs down the street is. Daily protests, starting at 7am, means you are woken by protestors chanting using loudhailers.  These protestor regroup about 3pm obviously to try and deter guests arriving to check in at the Hotel Frank. On at least 2 nights loud hailers were used till about 10pm.(I think the protestors must have restrictions that they cant start before 7am and can go no later than 10pm)\\n\\nThese protests have been going for over 6 months and there appears to be no sign of a resolution. I cant believe that the Local Authority and Business Groups allow these people to disrupt such a large area - Hotel Diva and so many other businesses/restaurants and hotels have to suffer for the actions of others. \\n\\nWe enjoyed the hotel and the excellent close proximaty to Union Square and shopping. We chose not to move to a room at the rear of the hotel or away from the street but I dont think this would have blocked out the loudhailers.\\n\\nYes - we would stay here again having now experienced the circumstances as outlined for ourselves.

My only complaint would be that the room taxes were not thoroughly spelled out when I booked the room.  There was an Occupancy tax, a CA tourist tax, a San Francisco tourist tax,  and a parking tax that added $63.00 per night to the room cost.\\n\\nNext time, I will probably go to the local W Hotel.  The taxes will be the same, but the overall cost/night will be cheaper..........for a property that is equally as hip, a larger hotel, with a little more going on.",4,positive

I received confirmation of that cancellation.  Two days after the check-in date, I saw a charge for over $1200 show up on my account from the hotel.  I promptly called the hotel (and please note their auto operator is the most obnoxious and pretentious thing I have ever heard) to find out what this charge was, and was informed it was due to a No-Show.  When I informed them that I had cancelled two weeks ago and had confirmation of this that I would be happy to provide, they said they had not received it and that the would not refund my money.   This led to a call to Expedia customer service and after a little run-around with them I was connected to someone who contacted the hotel on my behalf and managed to straighten things out. However, I now have to wait several business days to have my money refunded - of which NEVER should have been taken in the first place, AND had to have Expedia straighten it out because this hotel clearly only cares about accommodating their agreement with Expedia but not the actual customer.  If this is how the hotel treats potential guests, I would absolutely hate to see how they treat their real guests and will never book there for personal or business travel.

At check in, the front desk staff was friendly and conversational and even gave us a bottle of wine.\\n\\nWe were given room 501, close to the elevator on the 5th floor and with a view of 5th St. The room was enormous! There was a large closet with full-length mirrored doors. The closet contained a safe and an iron. The bathroom was the size of some apartments. It had a large vanity with tons of storage, a huge shower, and the toilet slightly separated in a little alcove, where there was also more shelf storage. The bathroom lighting was good. The Neil George bath products were lovely.\\n\\nWe had 2 queen beds that were incredibly comfortable with soft, high quality sheets.

There were plenty of outlets around the room, which is often something I find lacking in hotels, and the clock on the nightstand included USB ports for even easier device charging.\\n\\nWe used the standard free Wi-Fi in the room, and it was more than acceptable.

Fun and edgy, yet with somewhat sophisticated decor. There\\'s a London phonebooth by the elevator, they have chandeliers of broken glass, and little touches like lemon-infused water available by check-in. Altogether thoughtful and filled with curiosities.\\u00a0\\n- The Cavalier is a premier restaurant with amazing food, and the bar is also fantastic. Phenomenal decor, service, and all around vibe.\\u00a0\\n- Great common space with a playroom that has a shuffleboard, pool table, piano, and soccer pachinko (you\\'ll know it when you see it). There was even a VR booth by the entrance.\\u00a0\\n- 2 bottles of water are provided, free of charge, in your room. No other hotel I\\'ve stayed in the area (and I\\'ve stayed in plenty) provides this. It\\'s such a basic but fantastic amenity.\\u00a0\\n- There\\'s even a bluetooth Jambox that you can use, which is great.

Even after I called down to the desk to let them know, they weren\\'t able to fix it. I had to link to a backup connection. We worked through it, but seriously, what the heck.\\u00a0\\n- The fitness room (yay, 24 hr access) is small and PACKED in the mornings, with a line virtually out the door. yikes.\\u00a0\\n- The room itself was SO sparsely decorated. 90% of the walls are white with nothing on them, which feels more cold and uninviting than modern or minimalist. (take a look at the photo). There is more decoration in a square foot of the service stairs than in the guest rooms, which was surprising and makes little sense.\\u00a0\\n- All in all, as soon you as walk into the rooms the place immediately feels like a poorly refurbished OLD building. The lighting is all over the place with varying wattages and warmth levels, and it altogether feels ragtag and careless. The floor is laminate that bubbles in a lot of areas and desperately needs to be replaced. The only carpet in the room is a vintage rug just around the bed.\\u00a0\\n- The bedding was possibly the most uncomfortable I\\'ve ever had at a &gt;3 star hotel; it was heavy and sparse (not warm).\\u00a0\\n- When the bathroom door opens it blocks the ENTIRE hallway, which requires me to maneuver my body around it to get in or out. This was mildly infuriating. I really hope this was only the case in my room and not all of them. They really should replace this with a simple sliding door mechanism.\\u00a0\\n- Any other 4 star hotel I\\'ve stayed in provides slippers and other thoughtful touches throughout the stay, but there was none.\\u00a0\\n\\nAll in all, the hotel lobby almost makes up for the fact that the rooms were extremely lackluster.

And as I write this review from the hotel, I asked for a 1 hour late check out on Tuesday and the response, we can accommodate you for 15 minutes. So I can check out at 12:15 instead of 12. \\nBottom line if you have options you can do much better for much less.",3,negative

There was no chance of getting to sleep on Saturday night at 3am due to a party in a room a few doors down, and this was not the first time that it was noisy during our three night stay.

OUT/com/60713/112304/330073214.html,Hotel Zetta San Francisco,"""We just came back from a three-night stay at the Hotel Zetta. Here\\'s what I thought:\\n\\nThe Good:\\n- pet-friendly - we took our senior chihuahua with us and she seemed to like the place.\\n- centrally-located to all the shopping you could possibly want and need. Yes, it\\'s close to the Tenderloin but the dividing line is Market, so it\\'s easy to keep within Union Square and not accidentally venture off into the wrong area (which has happened before when we used to stay in Nob Hill).\\n- the Playroom with all sorts of games and a photo booth was a big hit with my son\\n- the restaurant (The Cavalier) was really good for brunch.\\n- got our room during their Fall sale and got upgraded from a Superior King to a Deluxe King by the staff that checked us in.\\n- stellar service from the middle-aged Asian valet. He was the only one whose service impressed us - he greeted us every time he saw us, apologized for any delays in getting the car, helped us get balls for the play room and took a genuine interest in my son and our visit to the city.\\n- friendly check-in staff (Kristen and the Filipina gal) who tried to accommodate our dog issues + upgraded our room (and gave us free water and chocolates upon arrival)\\n\\nThe Bad:\\n- rooms are tiny! I was worried about the room I booked as it said 250 sqft. That is miniscule and maybe would work for a single business traveler but not for a family of 3 + a dog. Thankfully, they upgraded us to a deluxe, which was 350 sqft. - it was still really small though and had a view of the escape stairwell and alley. \\n-no tub and could not figure out how to work the hand-held shower. This was not good for our toddler and dog, who ended up not bathing during the entire time (ugh). Actually, SF is so dirty that I feel like my dog has to bathe every time she goes walking in the streets. So i bathed her the 2nd day in the small sink, which she hated.\\n- housekeeping did not come to clean during the times we requested so we had no housecleaning for 4 days! I went to one of them and they said that no timeframe was provided to then by the front desk, so they didn\\'t know to do it while we were out. I think this is the front staff\\'s fault\\n- front desk needs to be trained for service, friendliness and professionalism. Maybe I have been spoiled by service at higher-end hotels, but having a client service background myself, I just couldn\\'t appreciate how most of the staff interacted with guests. Again, aside from the valet guy and the two women on check-in, everyone was indifferent and didn\\'t seem to care. The woman with an Australian accent (?) checked me out and couldnt even be bothered with what she was doing. When I disputed the bill, she called the manager who said to just change the rate. The manager did not acknowledge me at all and neither of them made any apologies for the mistake. And again, I\\'m pretty sure it was one of them who did not communicate to the housekeeping staff the details of our request.\\n- little things in the room that were not up to standard: we had no remote and had to request for one, the charger provided didnt work, our phone did not work and engineering had to fix it, the water beside the beds were deceiving (we thought they were free and only saw too late that a small price was imprinted on the bottle cap!)\\n- reservation and billing mix-ups so check your bill carefully. During check-in, I was told I had two reservations; however, I only made one. During checkout, they charged me a much higher daily rate than I booked. Thankfully, I keep my confirmations so I showed them as proof. This is when I told the lady with the accent, &quot;Oh, your computer might not have picked up the 20% fall promo rate since the math adds up to that&quot; and she flatly replied &quot;I don\\'t really know what happened.&quot; No apologies, no small talk, nothing. \\n- though they are pet-friendly, they seem to make a big deal about leaving pets in the room. I travel with my dogs all the time and even though they always indicate in the agreement that pets shouldnt be left alone, they never really make a big fuss about it. Here, during check in, they called me out on it as I mentioned that we were going to dinner. We had to spend so much time trying to find a way to make it work and I appreciate the ladies who tried to help me. But if a hotel says they are pet-friendly, they need to expect that there are times pets will be left alone, especially in a big city. Do they expect guests to bring them to fine dining restaurants, museums or cultural events?! If this is something that you will require guests to do, you should change the pet policy and not accept pets then.",3,negative

It is indeed ideally situated for visiting San Francisco\\'s main sights and shopping. It is also only a very short walk from the Powell Street BART station where we arrived directly from the airport. Although we arrived mid-morning, our room was already available, which we greatly appreciated, having had a very early start from New York. We found the staff at the reception systematically welcoming, courteous and most helpful. They spent time with us explaining in detail how to get to the various places which we wanted to visit by public transport, without pushing us to take taxis or town cars, and recommending places close by for brunch. They and the bell boys were also most helpful in trying to resolve a problem with the town car which they\\'d ordered for me to go back to the airport at the end of my stay, a problem which was in no way their fault. Our room on the top/8th floor was spacious and clean. We liked the contemporary d\\u00e9cor of the room and of the hotel in general.

So it\\'s hard to really get the full vibe of the place but there were a lot of good things experienced.  The overall aesthetic was clean, and interesting design driven materials used throughout. The lobby and lobby bar aren\\'t that big, more like a cozy boutique.  So if you want something more boutique and low key it seems this is gonna be more of the vibe.  The location is perfect - right of Market, close to everything.  The service was helpful.\\n\\nThe rooms were cool - like a hip loft.  Hardwood dark floors, Patterned persian-like rugs, lighting that is hugely design driven but still works well in providing light. Good beds.  The heating/cooling feature is a bit hard to figure out.  it\\'s very sensitive to movement in the room and a set temperature that they create (that you can change but will still go back to what they pre-programmed).  Kind of annoying. They say it\\'s to conserve, but I also guess it saves the hotel money. The other thing I didn\\'t love was the huge bottles of shampoo and body soap.   I\\'ve never liked the big communal bottles, like I\\'m in a community gym.  Seems like a super cheap way to go.  Again, I\\'m sure conserving is the motto but I still didn\\'t like it AT ALL. \\n\\nAgain, I am hard pressed to give it a final review until it\\'s fully functional.  But so far it doesn\\'t feel as cozy and as luxury as Vitale. From all I can gather it appears to be more moderately priced hotel.  If it goes up to high end prices it may turn me off.",4,positive

Somewhat claustrophobic, I asked for a different room. This one had 2 windows, facing the same gray wall and a dirty surface - practically 5 steps away from the windows of the room across from me. Creepy and weird. Why would I spend more than $300, in a hotel that according to its employees was \\'not busy\\', to be facing a dirty wall? And the AC sounded like a 747 was landing in my room. The room service menu was at best mediocre and weird. Unless if chicken nuggets are now good for adults. And you can order packaged potato chips for room service. What a novelty.

The lounge is open 24-7 and contributes to a vibrant feel to the place when you walk in.\\n\\nI was there for 5 nights and by the end I was ready to leave.  My gripes, in no particular order:\\n\\n- I sent out some shirts for steaming/pressing and they didn\\'t return when they said they would be there, and I got them a full day later after I called and waited a long time for someone to track them down.  It was very expensive and there was no consideration for the delay.\\n- The AC wasn\\'t working in my room so their solution was to install a window unit.  It did the job but it was loud.  I called about it and there wasn\\'t a lot they could really do about this, apparently.\\n- Breakfast in the Cavalier was chaotic at best.  One morning I ordered toast with peanut butter and orange juice since I thought it would be the quickest choice (having learned from previous mornings not to order anything more extensive).  It took them 15 minutes for someone to come and tell me that they don\\'t have peanut butter.  I could have made 5 rounds of toast by then and had only had my orange juice at that point.  They had the good sense not to charge me for my COLD toast when it was brought to me in a to-go container as I had a schedule to keep.  I was with a group for business who had pre-arranged the account so I couldn\\'t very well go elsewhere as I definitely would have.\\n- I attempted to order room service/breakfast the morning before I checked out in an attempt to streamline my morning and let me pack uninterrupted.  I was told on the phone the night before that they don\\'t do in-room service.  I called the next morning and \\'surprise!\\' - they do.  I don\\'t know how they could confuse that but apparently someone didn\\'t get the memo.  For a ridiculous amount of money I got ONE CUP of cling-wrapped coffee, cold toast, and no butter/jam.  Any other hotel knows that a carafe of coffee is the norm.  I had to call and get butter and jam - but the fruit with mint and honey was good.  Not worth what I paid when I only had a small cup of coffee.  Stingy!\\n- My safe wasn\\'t bolted to anything so anyone could have walked out with it.  It was promptly fixed but I\\'m not sure how this was missed by previous guests or housekeeping.\\n- My room faced the back and garbage collection seemed to come on time between 5:30-6:30am on 3/5 mornings.  Not great when there are several loads/trucks and the backup beepers were also in full swing for 10-15 minutes.  By then, there is no way to get back to sleep so you might as well just wake up.\\n- My final bill was not accurate and they make it impossible to interpret any charges from the Cavalier restaurant.

I booked the Zetta Suite for my wedding trip in June, 2015. When I arrived, I found out that they had accidentally overbooked this unique room and someone else was staying in it. Instead of just apologizing and putting me in a standard room, the staff of the Hotel Zetta created a new suite, just for us. They took two adjacent rooms, and replaced one of the rooms with living room furniture, closely matching the design of the original suite. Further, they lowered the price significantly. We ended up with more space for less cash out of pocket! The lobby of the Zetta is fantastic... make sure to check out the chandelier made out of eye-glasses. The game room was perfect for us; one of our wedding guests brought their kid along. Actually, the game room was great for kids and adults alike. Claudia, one of the concierges, took exceptional care of us during out stay. Since it was my wedding trip, I wanted to have flowers and treats awaiting all of our guests when they checked in.

The Game Room on the 2nd Floor....fun place to hang after dinner if you are out with Friends in the city and dont want a big night out on the town....It\\'s really a unique experience\\n2.

There\\'s Bloomingdales and Nordstrom and coming from SoCal, the selection is awesome in this location.\\n\\nThings I didn\\'t love:\\n....(not much)\\nI will say that there are some rooms that have interior facing windows (no view). It makes the room cozier and is private, but if you are claustrophobic (sp?) then request an &quot;outer facing&quot; room. The decor is eclectic mid-century artsy modern....I love the wood headboards. Makes the rooms feel really welcoming. \\n2. There is a very limited room service menu. If you are vegetarian...forget it. However, there\\'s a really cool &quot;pub-like&quot; restaurant at the hotel and if you call down you can ask to be transferred there, order from them and tip them to bring food up to you (separate from the room service menu).

Excellent shopping and numerous dining options for all budgets in the mall and Union Sq vicinity. Because of its location, we felt pretty safe hanging out late and will not bother by the few homeless that you will encounter throughout the city - just walk on by without eye contact or engaging them. \\n\\nPublic transport to all major tourist sites readily available on either Market or Mission street. Download the highly accurate 511 Transit app on your phone for accurate bus arrival since some buses do not run too frequently.\\n\\n2) Modern hotel where everything works unlike so many aging hotels in the city. The ample bedroom and bathroom spaces easily fit our family of four. \\n\\n3) Active lobby bar and the priceless game space on the 2nd floor. My teens and ourselves spent hours in the evening bonding over pool, table tennis and board games in the relaxing game area whilst enjoying ice cream treats from the nearby Ghiradelli ice cream parlor or Walgreen convenience shop/pharmacy.\\n\\n4) Innovative green friendly hotel - equipped with latest tech gadgets and effective basic wifi (not all rooms though).

They were nice enough to let me check in early and use their fridge and freezer behind the front desk all weekend but there were a multiple occasions in which I got serious attitude when asking them to get my bottles so I could add bottles to my milk supply. I felt blamed when I pointed out that one of the staff misunderstood me and put my milk in the freezer instead of the fridge (which I said was ok but I was just surprised by bc there are certain rules for using frozen breastmilk once it thaws and I had to travel back home) and I felt like I was really putting the front desk person out even though this was at like 2-5am so there was like no one else there. This was my first time pumping away from home and this made it much more stressful. ",2,negative

Some of the minor misses would be having to hear the occupants in adjacent rooms (but it sounded like they were talking extra-loud and being extra-exuberant); if they spoke in their normal volumes I suppose I wouldn\\'t hear a thing.  The a/c unit was also quite loud, but didn\\'t bother me too much.  I\\'d rather be in a noisy cool room than a quiet, but overly warm room (plus I always bring earplugs).  The double-paned window opened could open, which is what I did on my first day.  When I looked to the side-street below, I saw a bunch of industrial trash containers.  Not a great sight and you don\\'t see them if you look straight out the window.  However, the trash containers are kind of smelly and there are flies.  I mention this not because of the smell (which I didn\\'t notice) but because a fly found its way into the room.  I managed to chase it back out and I kept the window shut from then on.  That\\'s it, I don\\'t have much else to complain about.\\n\\nA hotel like this deserves multiple return visits, which I intend to do.",4,positive
OUT/com/60713/112304/237263297.html,Hotel Zetta San Francisco,"""The location of Hotel Zetta can\\'t be beat. Just off Market Street, close to Union Square, the cable car turn around and Westfield Center.\\n\\nWe booked a Deluxe King, but upon arrival were told the hotel was overbooked (Giants - World Series) and we were being upgraded to a Premier Studio King.  Unfortunately, the room faced an airshaft which is great for sleeping, but had zero natural light and blinds had to be kept closed as the we faced other rooms across the airshaft. The room was comfortable and well appointed, but the lack of any view/natural light was a turn off.\\n\\nGiven the price we paid, I was hoping for something slightly nicer.",3,negative
OUT/com/60713/112304/154090658.html,Hotel Zetta San Francisco,"""So I made the decision to attend a conference in San Francisco about a month before the conference.  The only problem is that all the conference hotels are booked and the other ones within a reasonable walking distance to the Moscone Center are well over $600 / night on average which is not going to make our corporate travel manager very happy at all. \\n\\nSo, I find the Hotel Zetta which was currently under construction for less than half of what the other nearby places are going for.  Of course, it\\u2019s not open yet and only scheduled to be open a week before I arrive.  I figure this will either be the greatest coup to score a brand-new room close to Moscone or I\\u2019m going to be sleeping on the street somewhere.  The reality is that this was somewhere in between.  \\n\\nI arrive at  the hotel on a Sunday and the very first thing I notice is a sign on the front door stating the hotel fire alarm is not working.  Really?!  How can they be open?   The sign says something about having a 24-hour manned fire watch.  Having been in the Army and stayed in WWII barracks on several occasions, I know what a \\u201cfire watch\\u201d is and I can say the hotel\\u2019s definition vastly differs on what a \\u201cfire watch\\u201d is.  I never saw anyone from the hotel on fire watch - unless, of course the lobby was going to catch on fire.  Then they would have been ready. \\n\\nHey, I\\u2019m already gambling with the hotel, so let\\u2019s let it ride!\\n\\nI\\u2019m at the hotel around 1pm and they tell me my room is not ready.  Ok, I fully understand it\\u2019s a bit early and it\\u2019s no problem.  I leave my cell number with the front desk, they give me some recommendations on restaurants, hold my bag and off I go.  I don\\u2019t get a call, but run out of things to do (and am tired) so head back to the hotel around 4.  Big difference.  The lobby is full of guests and you can tell they\\u2019re all waiting on rooms. Of course, mine is still not ready. Frankly, it appeared that it was now more of a \\u201cwhoever\\u2019s been in the lobby waiting the longest get\\u2019s the room first.\\u201d   There are at least 5 staff members huddled around the terminals at the front desk - it looks like they\\u2019re trying to save Apollo 13 up there.  After about 45 minutes of waiting in the lobby they finally have a room ready for me. \\n\\nI ask for my bag and they say they\\u2019ll bring it up.  I\\u2019m pretty much a self-service kind of guy so I tell them I\\u2019d like to take it myself.  Nope.  They insist they\\u2019ll bring it right up.  Ok.  Get to the room - first impression is \\u201cnice.\\u201d   It\\u2019s well decorated and modern.  It\\u2019s a little stuffy so I go to turn on the AC - nope.  Does not appear to have power.   Call down to the front desk and they tell me they\\u2019ll have an engineer there in 10 minutes.  Nope.  After 30 mins, I head to the front desk and there\\u2019s the bellman with my bad getting off the elevator.  I remind him I am waiting for the engineer. He says he\\u2019ll get him right there.  Nope.  Another 30 mins pass and I head to the front desk.  \\u201cOh, he\\u2019s on his way there, you should get back to the room.\\u201d  Ok, back to the room and meet the engineer.  He says \\u201cYeah, a bunch of HVAC units don\\u2019t work up here.  I don\\u2019t know why the front desk is telling people I\\u2019ll fix them. They know they don\\u2019t work\\u201d.  &lt;sigh&gt;.   Back to the front desk... &lt;long story short&gt; after an hour and 5 different rooms, I finally find one room where the fan comes on, though no cold air.  Too tired to keep trying, I take it. \\n\\nI settle in, plug my iPad into the outlet on the desk and hit the sack.  Wake up in the morning and the iPad is not charged.  Weird.  Investigate and it seems the power strip behind the desk is not working.  After 10 minutes of fiddling with the power strip and trying different outlets I determine that only the one outlet with the power strip is not working.  The other outlet with the minifridge is working fine. On a whim, I try one of the two (unlabeled) switches by the front door and what do you know - the power strip, phone, and desk lamp all come to life.  Why, Hotel Zetta, why?  Does the desk lamp really need to be on a light switch across the room? \\n\\nMy stay was pretty uneventful.  I had to open the windows each evening to get some cooler air in there and of course, had to deal with all the dumpsters being emptied and construction projects that happen between 3 and 5am.  The outer window only opens 3 inches, so if there is a fire (not that I would know about it) I\\u2019m most likely toast. \\n\\nOh, the in-room WiFi... first night, jump on wifi with the iPad, no issues.  No nag screen or anything.  Second night, there\\u2019s a nag screen, but no problem, it lets me put in my info and off I go.  On the 3rd night, I need to jump on with my laptop.  Try to get on and it wont let me.  Weird that my iPad still works.  Oh, I see now on the nag screen - \\u201cWiFi is for one device.  For $15 / day you can get up to 5 devices and VPN.\\u201d  REALLY?  I can\\u2019t VPN without paying $15 / day?  I suppose it\\u2019s a moot point because I could not ever successfully join my laptop to the WiFi.  There\\u2019s no place on the nag screen to disenroll the iPad.  I call the front desk for help thinking this will be simple - they\\u2019ll give me some code to get in. Nope. They guy at the desk says \\u201cno, there\\u2019s nothing I can do but I can give you the number to our tech support.  And if they can\\u2019t help you, just pick the $15 option and we\\u2019ll comp you.\\u201d  Ok, that\\u2019s nice enough.  Call tech support.  Rings about 20 times, then nothing.  Ok, let\\u2019s try the $15 option.  Nope.  Won\\u2019t let me go through with it. Ok, let\\u2019s call tech support again. Nope, still no answer after 20 rings.  I give up for the night.  For a hotel that lauds itself as being tech friendly, I am not impressed.  \\n\\nOn the last day, they removed my shower head which had been there all week and left me with just the hand sprayer thingy.  Yeah, the sprayer does mount to the wall (and shoots water at you  horizontally), but still - WHY?  Why can\\u2019t I have a normal shower head like I had all week, Hotel Zetta? \\n\\nCheck out time. They can\\u2019t print a receipt.  Say they\\u2019ll email it to me.  Nope - never got it.  I had to call back the other day to get them to send me one. \\n\\nIt\\u2019s not all bad.  The bed sheets were some of the softest I have ever felt.  They\\u2019re great.  The staff was friendly, but not very well equipped to deal with a new hotel.  They seemed very inexperienced. \\n\\nBTW, the fire alarm (not working) signs stayed up all week in the hall on the floor I stayed on.   \\n\\nBottom line... Good:  Nice staff, good looking hotel, relatively close to Moscone, super bed. \\nBad:  Staff ill-equipped to deal with a new hotel, the \\u201cam I going to die in a fire\\u201d factor, difference of opinion regarding tech-friendliness, construction dust and goop all over the elevator doors and buttons. \\n\\nI have to echo what the other reviewers have said - this hotel opened way too early.  It turns out they actually had postponed their opening by several days due to the fire alarm and had only opened 3 days before I arrived.  I don\\u2019t doubt that they\\u2019ll finish the construction, certify the alarm is working, and clean everything up.  However, if it was me, I would look for other options until the \\u201ceverything is great\\u201d reviews start flowing in.",2,negative

I had a traditional check in, give ID and credit card, get charged for the stay then and there, and get your room key. For such a short stay I only had small bags so I did not use a bell hop or roller cart service, but it was offered. \\n\\nThe room was pristine clean, very trendy and designed well. The bathroom door was heavy but there was a large pass through big enough for ADA access if you have those concerns. The bathroom was very nice with a walk in shower and tons of bath products if you want to use them (which I did... the conditioner and shampoo smelled amazing). The TV was on with a personal greeting which was a nice touch. There was mini bar access with a $10 credit from your amenities package and there were little bottles of alcohol at the ready (vodka, whiskey, rum and tequila) with mixers in the fridge for easy access. Most of my plans out on the town took care of that desire but the prices on them I found to be reasonable for a hotel. \\n\\nI had a great day/night in the city. Upon returning to the hotel I was beat, just plopped on the bed and went to sleep. (Though I preface this with have a bad back, like really bad) I\\'m sure the beds upon reading other reviews are fine, it just didn\\'t work for my back that night so that part was a tad uncomfortable for me. I checked out in the morning, was greeted again by Dave at the valet when my car was pulled around, he was awesome and friendly again, even offered bottled waters for the drive home!  \\n\\nI had a couple sna-foos later that day with the check out process. However, I had the pleasure of having a communication exchange with Mr. Beevor, the general manager of the property, after trying to rectify the situation with other staff of the hotel. He was extremely kind, understanding and reasonable and corrected all the problems I faced upon check out.  Thank you for making the experience better overall.",4,positive

OUT/com/60713/112304/627157705.html,Hotel Zetta San Francisco,"""This boutique hotel doesn\\'t deliver quality to the price point that it charges.The location is good &amp; close to the centre of SF, as well as public transport links. The check in process was easy &amp; fairly quick. The fitness centre was adequate &amp; easily accessible at all times. There were some added experiences such as a VR station in the lobby that was staffed by a friendly helpful person, as well as a reasonable bar with a pool table in it.There are too many negative aspects to my stay to make me want to come back here again. The room was a decent size for a city centre hotel, but the wifi not working well in it wasn\\'t very helpful. We ended up using the communal areas for anything that required wifi, but this is in turn wasn\\'t the easiest thing to do with so many private functions on in the hotel that limited some of the areas you could use. The room also had no decent mirror in it, and oddly only had 1 dressing gown in a double room - only minor points but at over $400/nt, the level of quality should be higher than this.At such a room cost, and with areas of the resort the were off-limits quite frequently, the addition of a non-optional $25/nt &quot;resort fee&quot; comes across as miserly. This is an addition of something that you don\\'t want, for some features that you don\\'t need. There is a small minibar credit that comes with this nightly fee, but it isn\\'t clear that this is a one-off credit irrespective of the length of stay (and thus repeated $25/nt charges), as opposed to a repeating credit for each night. The various added &quot;experiences&quot; such as VR use, or games consoles, are a nice enough option, but it is a bit rich to charge $25/nt on top of an already expensive room charge for these non-requested, non-essential additions. Declining room cleaning is encouraged in a more sustainable, green approach, with some minibar credit, but it was never clear that this happened and wasn\\'t applied on check-out.The staff could be more knowledgeable about some things that would be pertinent to people staying there - I asked about public transport info, but they suggested using Google maps, which they helpfully &amp; non-ironically advised me that I could get on my phone, or just using Uber. This is a pretty low level of knowledge for a hotel serving a reasonable tourist population, next to one of the major public transport interchanges in SF.This hotel is a long way short of something like the Soho House brand, while charging something similar, if not more.",2,negative

I noted the &quot;hip&quot; outfits of the front door staff with jeans, checkered shirts, and newsboy caps.

Clean and modern decor.\\n\\nThe bathroom was bright and clean.  I had a few issues with the bathroom, though.  I was expecting more toiletries for the price of the room.  Only liquid soap was a letdown (I prefer bar soap for the shower).  The shower head was rather highly placed, so it might be difficult for some to reach the shower head for readjusting.  Also, the faucet of the sink was too close to the edge.  Yes, these are minor points, but they are things that could be improved.\\n\\nI was not happy with the complete lack of view from my room.

Location was excellent for a tourist in San Francisco for a few days as it\\'s just off Union Square and next to the Powell Street BART and turntable for the cable car. \\nHowever, I found that such a nicely laid out hotel and location were let down by a few things which make a whole lot of difference to a traveller. \\n1. One of the 2 smoke-free rooms we were in was reeking with the smell of cigarette smoke when we checked in. The room needed fumigation and a complete change of beddings and curtains. True, the housekeeping responded by bringing an &quot;ioniser&quot; up to the room to help alleviate the smell but this was merely eyewash. So much for the little note they leave on your bedside table on check-in which says &quot; Welcome to your smoke-free room&quot; and the little note about adding a cleaning fee should you violate the smoke-free status. Guess the last guy and the cleaners subsequently didn\\'t see this !\\n2. Who thought up that shower system ? The lever to switch from the wall spout to the handheld shower head is impossible for those below 5ft5inches to reach and even if they could, the one in one of my rooms was virtually impossible to pull out to switch water sources !\\n3. One of our shower doors was installed backwards - so the bathroom floor got wet after each shower and the door made a sickening bone crunching crack each time it was opened or closed\\n4. Mattresses are too soft - so for those with orthopaedic problems, be warned - you will not get a restful sleep. The hotel had nothing to offer as an alternative or solution when we brought this up. My wife was on pain killers for her backache throughout our stay in San Francisco because of this. \\n5. Service at the front desk was polite but somewhat cold and impersonal. I particularly enjoyed the profiling when we asked about directions to good eating places and Union square upon check-in and the staff responded immediately by directing us to Chinatown!!!

I applaud Zetta for this. Other bad point was we came back from fishermans warf to chill at the bar, play some pool etc but when we got back we found there was a private function on For GE. So we couldnt use the facilities. If we had been notified we could have made other arrangements. Management was however accomodating and they discounted our dinner at the restaraunt for the inconvenience which was good. \\nA few minor problems but friendly staff and central location make for good hotel for business etc. ",3,negative

Around this area are plenty of taxis, coffee shops, trams and all the tourist sights nearby such as Union Square. \\n\\nThe hotel - I did a lot of research into this as the majority of nights I was paying for myself.

From the reviews I read, and from the majority of people I saw at the hotel, most looked like they were in San Fran for business.

OUT/com/60713/112304/381758434.html,Hotel Zetta San Francisco,"""We stayed in a Superior Room, which was certainly very comfortable. Spacious, with a comfortable (Super) King size bed with top quality bed linen, and effective blackout curtains - this really is a place to get some really good sleep. The room is modern in design - fairly minimalist decor with white walls and wooden floors, It is also well-equipped with a clock radio/iPod dock, USB charging points by the bed, a desk and (atypically comfortable) chair, armchair and footstool, cupboards, wardrobes, desk light, lamps, Illy coffee machine, a kettle (upon request) and teabags,and a minibar.  There is complimentary wifi and \\'additional charge\\' wifi. We only used the former and it was irritating - working fairly well when it decided to work, but frequently demanding the user name and password get re-entered several times per day - most annoying!  Our room had no view to speak of - it overlooked an internal light shaft (\\'courtyard\\' would be too generous a description). We did not intend to spend much time in the hotel so did not raise an objection to being allocated this particular room, although I do think that, however well-sized and equipped a room is, a room with such a poor aspect should never be termed a \\'Superior\\' room. (It certainly did not make us feel superior!). We kept our curtains closed at all times as this was preferable to the \\'view\\' outside.  The bathroom was spacious, with a great power shower, although there was a large (intentional) hole in the shower screen for I know not what purpose, which served to soak the toilet roll positioned on the other side of the shower cubicle. Bizarre! The products were in large (not-to-be-taken-away!) dispensers and were by Neil George. These were lovely and felt very luxurious. The hotel bar/reception area is buzzy and trying to be very cool with its modern and \\'funky\\' decoration. It has been \\'thought through\\' and \\'designed\\' within an inch of its life and for me was just the wrong side of cool - too obviously trying to be quirky and different.  Also the air conditioning in this area was aways on extremely high, making the receptionists shiver and us (after the first night) avoid the bar area because we did not want to have to wrap up in so many clothes whilst having a drink. This space was twice used for corporate receptions during our stay, which meant that the upstairs part of the reception/bar area was temporarily out of bounds to hotel guests.  This did not bother us particularly, but might annoy others. We did not eat breakfast or dinner in the hotel (- there are plenty of great options for both within walking distance), although I understand the quality in the restaurant to be high. Certainly the service from all the members of the staff we encountered was professional and warm. There is valet parking (at an additional fee) which we did not use. There is a hotel gym which we also did not use, but no pool.  The location is great for mainstream shopping, close to Union Square, the theatres, and the cable car. However there is a huge homelessness problem in San Francisco (which was striking even for people like us from the UK) and many of these unfortunate people seem to hang out in the area of San Francisco close to the Zetta hotel. This did not cause us any particular problem and we did not feel threatened at all, although the frequent requests for money can become an irritation when walking about the city.  The standard of service and comfort at the Zetta is generally good, but for the negative reasons included above, I would look for an alternative hotel in a different part of the city next time I am in San Francisco.",3,negative

Both check in and check out were fine, with the staff very friendly and the lobby decor very inviting. And that\\'s where our enjoyment of the Zetta began and ended. \\n\\nOur upgraded room had mostly mismatched drab gray furniture that looked like it was bought from a school inventory surplus sale. The lighting was harsh and limited, making us feel like we were in a dormitory in some former Eastern bloc country. There was no lighting above/around/near the reading chair, with the primary lighting source above the bed. This made it impossible to relax in bed or relax out of bed in any meaningful way. The bedside lamps were impossible to figure out how to turn on/off and became a frustrating &quot;do I double tap the button, hold the up/down dimmers, a combination thereof, just please turn on/off already!&quot; experience every night. Only one side of the bed had any outlets or any means to plugin/charge a phone. \\n\\nOn our first night a maintenance man knocked on our door at 6pm wanting to &quot;upgrade&quot; our beside clock. Surely this could\\'ve waited until we checked out. It wasn\\'t something we requested and wasn\\'t something that needed to interrupt our stay to do. \\n\\nThe bathroom light switches were encrusted with very noticeable grime and dirt, and the shower grout had noticeable splotches. Wasn\\'t sure if this was grout stain wearing off (looked like the grout was stained to match the dark brown of the tile) or that it was in serious need of a deep clean, or a combination thereof, but it was unpleasant nonetheless and didn\\'t feel very &quot;deluxe.&quot; \\n\\nWe were told that our amenity fee included a $10 minibar credit, and that we\\'d get another $10 credit if we declined housekeeping. We didn\\'t have housekeeping come in during our stay, but we also didn\\'t explicitly decline it. We ate two $6 minibar items, but noticed after check out that we got charged in full for one of them. Regardless if we didn\\'t get the second $10 credit, it seems we should only have been charged $2 at most, not $6. I know, whether it\\'s $2 or $6, it\\'s a paltry amount to quibble about, but it\\'s still annoying to be charged for something we shouldn\\'t have. \\n\\nWhile the staff checking us in/out were super friendly, the person working the main desk when we returned late from dinner our first night literally scowled at us when we walked past. &quot;Hello, good evening,&quot; I said as we walked by. *Desk person stares at us without saying anything.* \\n\\nOn the whole, the Zetta was just &quot;okay&quot; -- hence the three stars.

Nothing life threateningly wrong about our stay, but nothing about our experience that makes us want to book a return visit.

Room was spacious and modern. Great wireless internet connection and bed was very comfortable. Very easy walk to Moscone Center. All that said, bill for room and parking for one night came out to over 500 bucks ($55 to park overnight). That is less than I paid per night for the nicest luxury hotel in Switzerland!.

Spent days choosing but always looked at larger places and by passed this so many times as we didn\\'t know whether it would be ok for families. Amazing decor and the playroom for young and old is a brilliant idea. Had a double room and there was lots of room with a huge bathroom and large walk in shower. Location is great and within walking distance to the cable car and metro plus it is next door to Westfields and heaps of other shops. Read reviews about the homeless out on the streets in the area. We saw so few and never felt concerned. No different to seeing them on city streets at home. Staff at the hotel are great. So helpful and friendly and even gave us water for our big bus tour plus helped with tickets. Lovely reception /bar area where there are lots of comfy chairs to relax in. The Cavalier restaurant is really nice but particularly noisy on a Friday night as it\\'s obviously where the crowd after work go as they also have a bar so not a good night to take the kids!

This hotel seems to be pitching itself in the &quot;large boutique&quot; category in terms or its decor and ambience and in fairness it it does pretty well at hitting those targets, The reception desk is in the double height area which doubles as the bar area. The welcome was warm and efficient and my wife and I were quickly allocated our room. The room is where the hotel is let down. Sure, the linen is a good quality and the bed comfortable but our room (820) looked out into what might be a ventilation shaft. The views from city hotel rooms do not normally bother me but even on the 8th floor natural light was virtually non existant leading to an extremely dark room. The other big beef with the room was the aircon. now maybe we got unlucky with the location of the aircon unit in our room which was directly over the bed.. This unit was sooo loud, It made sleep even with jetlag from a European flight virtually impossible. When I complained to the front desk I was told The building was previously an industrial unit and the loud aircon was to be expected. Well my take is, it is no longer and industrial unit and that excuse doesnt cut the mustard.\\nOne other thing to be aware of with this hotel, Its location is an area high in numbers rough sleepers and hobos, I recognise this is not the hotel\\'s fault but If we had been aware we would have to walk around the area trying to avoid eye contact we would likely have choosen a different location",3,negative

So, I took his advice and booked a 2 night stay.\\n\\nUpon checking in, the Valet (Manager?) Sean greeted us and made us feel very welcomed. He was charming and funny, two key traits when meeting three mid-twenties females. We asked what there was to do in SF and he gave us a list of all of the exciting places to go to. He was very helpful. Whenever he saw us, he made sure to ask how our stay was going. He showed how much he cared about our stay and we truly appreciated it.\\nScott checked us in. He was very nice and professional. He accommodated us with a roll away bed, since there were three girls sleeping in a King room. By the time that we got to our room and put our bags down, the houseman, Donnie, was already knocking at our door to deliver the roll away. Talk about speedy service. Donnie greeted us and was very happy and smiling. He wished us a nice stay and left professionally. On our last day there, Donnie saw us in the lobby and approached us and said hello. \\nNow to speak about Edguardo. I had just walked out of my room and was carrying a large bag when Edguardo stopped what he was doing (we were at opposite ends of the hallway) and ran to the elevator to have it waiting for me by the time I got there. He held the door open for me to allow me to travel down to the lobby. I appreciated his kind manner, he was a true gentleman.\\nMaurice, we met at the manager training at Viceroy Santa Monica many months ago and we ran into each other in the elevator.

OUT/com/60713/112304/168799339.html,Hotel Zetta San Francisco,"""I\\'ll leave out the good stuff - you expect a hotel to have comfortable beds etc, don\\'t you? I\\'ll put in a good word for the doormen though - they do try hard and are good with the kids, &quot;Sean&quot; in particular.\\n\\nNow the problems: the noisy air-con/heater reported in other reviews is not an isolated problem. Our room was on the 5th floor (of 8 floors). When the thermostat hits the target, you can feel the cool airflow (presumably a fan) starting, and that is fine, but soon after that, something else (probably the compressor) starts and runs and there is a very noisy engine noise. I have an audio recording but I don\\'t think Tripadvisor accepts audio uploads. This noise cycles on and off all night - in the end we turned off the a/c altogether and slept better without it. We asked the front desk twice on different days to get an engineer to fix it. We never had a report back. Maybe they tried, maybe they didn\\'t. Probably it can\\'t be fixed without a refit of equipment.\\n\\nInternet access: some clarity is needed. The web site says: &quot;High-speed wired and wireless Internet access (complimentary and fee option)&quot;. So what does that mean? Well there is no &quot;wired&quot; access - we searched for an ethernet port in vain. So that part is simply untrue. On the &quot;complimentary and fee option&quot; I assumed this related to speed differences. I don\\'t need massive bandwidth, so I booked on that assumption, and there is indeed a 2Mbps up/down limit, which is adequate. However, it turns out that there is also a 1-device limit. The web site should be clear about that. It is a major turn-off if you have compared room rates on the basis that this one includes internet when other hotels don\\'t. Who these days travels with only one device? My wife and I have two smartphones, two tablets, one kindle and one laptop between us. And guess what - if there was an ethernet port, then I could have shared it (using Internet Connection Sharing in Windows or plugging in a travel router), so perhaps that explains the lack of one. The complimentary option also blocks VPN, for those of you looking to connect to your corporate office (don\\'t know whether the paid option does). When we checked in and complained about the undisclosed 1-device limit they offered to rebate us 2 out of 6 nights on the paid option (my guess: 1/3 or 33.3% is how much commission they get from the ISP). Too complicated. Even the $14.95/day (plus tax) paid option has a 5-device limit. The internet service provider is Eleven Wireless, Inc. There is free wi-fi in the lobby though.\\n\\nNext gripe: we booked a Premier Studio room, specifying 2 adults and 2 children in advance. The room has a King-size main bed and includes a Queen-size pull-out sofabed. No complaints with the beds, but the idea of 4 people staying in a room designed for 4 people seemed to be a novelty to the cleaning staff, who never left us 4 sets of towels. We started at 2, got 2 more after check-in, the next day these 4 were replaced with 3, and the next day with 2, and we got 2 more on request, and the next day back to 2. You would think that with our sofabed permanently deployed, they would automatically provide enough towels for 4 people.\\n\\nOne bug: when you press the message button on the phone with the helpful envelope icon above it, you get the front desk, not the voicemail system. You have to dial 100 for that, the front desk tells you.\\n\\nOne design flaw: the minibar is near the head of the bed, making it louder when you are sleeping than it needs to be.\\n\\nOther than that, the room is well-fitted and comfortable - but you expected that, didn\\'t you?",3,negative

The bathroom had splashes all up the walls especially around the toilet and the shower tiles had clearly not had a proper clean in a long time. The shower leaks out through a hole in the glass and soaks the toilet paper every time you shower.\\n\\nThe bed was big and comfy. \\n\\nLocation wasn\\'t great for us, too touristy, great if you want to stay in the middle of tourist town but there wasn\\'t much in the way of independent life around.

They were so friendly and accommodating!  I worked with Mohi to book the block of rooms we needed to accommodate our group and she was fantastic!  She was super easy to work with and was able to provide everything we needed.  She even gave out her cell phone number so the members of my party could call her directly to book their rooms.  When we got there, everything was ready for us!  All our rooms were ready to go and they even had all our room keys ready!!  It was one of the easiest group check-ins I\\'ve ever experienced.  From there, things just got better!  We were constantly traveling places in a large group and whenever they could, they would use their shuttle to take us and if the shuttle wasn\\'t available they would call us cabs.  They were always very friendly and happy every time we came and went from the hotel!!\\n\\nNext, let\\'s talk about the roof-top lounge!!  It was such a treat for us to have a place where we could all hang out as a group and visit and catch up.  And they aren\\'t lying when they say it\\'s open 24 hours and to go ahead and bring your own drinks and snacks!!  At least 2 of the nights we were up there past 1:00am and the staff never made us feel rushed or uncomfortable; they would just come up and check on us every once in a while to make sure we were doing ok.  There was great lounge furniture up there and plenty of seating as well as 2 heat lamps for when it got a little chilly and of course, the view was awesome!!!\\n\\nLastly, and certainly not least, the hotel rooms themselves were great!  They were a good size, the beds were comfortable and everything was very clean (and I\\'m a pretty hard judge of clean hotel rooms).  The location of the hotel itself was great for everywhere we needed to be in the City.

Pulling up to the hotel, you find yourself in one of the sketchiest neighborhoods of the country, second only to none other than Los Angeles\\' Skid Row. Being from LA I thought I was used to it, and wouldn\\'t mind, but the Tenderloin District proved to be a beast of its own nature. Bums are not grunting quietly in the shadows, tucked away in cardboard mansions and shopping carts, but having all out disco parties in the middle of the street, in packs of 8-10 at a time, everything from public defecation, passing crack pipes, and generally playing out what would be a odd nightmare. (I only say that because I hope your nightmares don\\'t consist of bum feces). Needless to say, we decided that the safest place to walk is the MIDDLE OF THE STREET, where we wouldn\\'t be harassed by herds of the homeless. I wish I could take a photo to post with the review, but didn\\'t want to display nice shiny objects. \\n\\n2. The parking situation is very interesting there. It\\'s $12 for 12 hours, and a bit more for oversized vehicles. The first valet guy up charged us about 5 bucks, and I wouldn\\'t have noticed if the second guy wouldn\\'t have given it away. After being confronted, he apologized and promised me a 20% discount on the next night, which was also up charged by the 3rd valet guy that I had to argue with. On top of all this, our window on the 3rd floor was facing the parking valet booth, where the ethnic gentlemen chattered in some foreign language in full volume, until about 2 AM. \\n\\nAnyhow, in short, if you plan on driving then there should be no problem with the local bums, but I would not suggest, under any circumstance, to walk your children, wives, girlfriends etc., outside of the hotel, even in broad daytime.",3,negative

We called the desk and were told to flip a switch by the door which turned on a blower in the ceiling, but there was no thermostat to adjust temperature.  This blew tepid air into the room, which actually made it feel worse. We resorted to a space heater that was in the corner - which is a pretty clear indication that management knows the heat situation isn\\u2019t adequate. Also, the hotel\\u2019s location is simply not good. We made the mistake of walking back after dinner one night and the neighborhood was very rough and filled with homeless people and drunks. I work in New York City and I\\u2019ve never felt as unsafe as I did walking back to the hotel that night. Plan on driving or using Uber after dark. The hotel does offer a free shuttle service to a few drop off points in the city, which can be convenient.  I\\u2019d like to give this more than a 3 star review because the price was right and there were a number of things we appreciated about it, but I can\\u2019t because of the location.",3,negative

As a first time visitor to San Francisco from Australia, I wanted to stay in a hotel that was situated within a good (and equal) proximity from the various tourist destinations (in all directions) that San Francisco has to offer as well as being within relatively close proximity to Candlestick Park. I was certainly not disappointed. \\n\\nThe quality of service the staff provided was impeccable. I must make special mention to Lorence, Latoya, Angel &amp; Mark whose friendly professional service and attention to detail ensured that my stay at Cova Hotel was a VERY pleasant and problem free experience. \\n\\nThe room I stayed in was very well maintained and serviced daily. I was happy with the cleanliness of my room. The bed was just right (not too hard or soft). And I found the house keeping staff to be courteous and friendly too. \\n\\nI was also impressed with their shuttle service which frequently transported visitors to and from Fisherman\\'s Wharf, as well as the Moscone Centre and Union Square. \\n\\nAnd the great breakfast provided on the 8th floor gave visitors the opportunity to enjoy their breakfast either indoors while taking in a view of the San Francisco skyline, or outside should the mood strike them. It is a very nice touch.\\n\\nThe professionalism and friendly service provided by the wonderful staff has ensured that next time I am to visit San Francisco, my first choice of lodging will be with Cova Hotel.",5,positive

OUT/com/60713/1119270/267613875.html,Cova Hotel,"""My husband and I stayed here for one night. I was impressed with the service. Our reservations were wrong (I believe due to the booking agency, not the hotel but who knows for sure) however they immediately switched us to an &quot;upgraded&quot; king room. The room was large, bright and clean. The decor is very minimal, cool and modern, it lent to the feeling of cleanliness for me. The television is hung on the wall to the side of the bed rather than at the foot, which was a little weird but it worked out okay. There was a fridge and Kurig coffee maker, as well as a snack basket with assorted snack foods that were complimentary with the room upgrade. My husband requested additional coffee pods, cream and sugar and it was provided quickly and with a smile. The bathroom had a really cool, all glass sink with a waterfall type faucet, as well as some great smelling lotion, shampoo, conditioner and soap. The shower had excellent water pressure. The bed was comfortable and large. We both slept well. Even the clock had a dimmed face so the bright numbers wouldn\\'t disturb our sleep. The positives outweighed the negatives by far, but I have to outline those as well. Again, a problem with the booking agency was that I paid extra for an upgraded breakfast option which the hotel no longer offers. When I mentioned this to the front desk they sympathized and said they had, had issues with the booking agency in the past and offered to let us order from the menu if we wanted, so again the service was excellent. The complimentary breakfast however was just odd. It was served in an adjacent restaurant and consisted of from what I can recall, cold hard boiled eggs, muffins, croissants, oatmeal, yogurt, (both oatmeal and yogurt were served family style, not in individual servings) cold cuts (only ham), cheese, whole apples and oranges, cold cereal and bread. There was no toaster to be found. Although I am sure you cold request it to be toasted, it was just awkward. We did not look at the menu, so I don\\'t know what the additional paid options were. Since it was in a restaurant, it would be nice if more of the complimentary items were hot, maybe scrambled eggs, toast, one of those nifty waffle makers. The only other negative was that parking cost us about $35.00 for the night because we have a larger car. But it is San Francisco, so that is to be expected. In conclusion, I wouldn\\'t be adverse to staying here again if in the area. In all honesty, I might look for a hotel with free parking though. Also, we did get a deeply discounted rate, the other listed prices were much higher and if we had paid that, I might have been upset about the paid parking and less than great breakfast.",4,positive

Why accept $150 on a card but not in cash? And $500 in cash? Do you really believe that your 3 star (being generous) hotel is worth a security deposit of $500? I stayed in the Delano in Las Vegas which is a 5 star luxury resort and only had to pay them $400 in cash. You need to re-think your policy. \\n\\nJames on reception was very rude.

I provided my receipt reference to that email to the reception staff and did not even receive an apology. James needs a lesson in customer service because he was extremely unhelpful and rude. By the time I arrived at the hotel it was 3am at home and therefore I could not use my debit card to authorise the deposit as my bank kept rejecting it. I needed to wait until the bank opened but this was just an inconvenience to James. When I advised that my hotel in LA which I stayed at the nights prior to this, did not ask for a security deposit, James asked me which hotel I stayed in and whilst I was trying to remember the full name he rolled his eyes.

Overall, my fiancee and I had a mostly great experience at Cova.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\nService - all of the staff members we interacted with were very friendly, helpful and professional.  We had an incident the last night we were there with some very loud guests down the hall causing a disturbance in the wee hours of the morning.  We called down to the front desk and they apologized for the noise and immediately came up and handled the situation. They also will call a taxi for you and have good recommendations for things to do around the city. \\n\\nValue - We paid 109 a night for our room, which was a standard room with a king sized bed.  Considering the prices of other hotels with much less amenities in San Francisco, I felt this was a great deal.  \\n\\nAmenities - Free wifi (which was surprisingly fast for a hotel), free continental breakfast which included whole apples and oranges, thick slices of whole wheat and white bread, sliced tomatoes, cucumbers, cheeses, deli ham and turkey, tea and coffee, an assortment of dry cereals, milk and orange juice and a self serve waffle maker.  They also have a nice little gym and a business center.  The internet access isn\\'t free in the business center, but it is free access and print off your boarding pass from your airline.  Otherwise it is 25 cents a minute for internet access.  It would be nice if they at least gave you 5 minutes for free to be able to print off other things like Alcatraz tickets or things of that nature.\\n\\nCleanliness - I felt that our room was clean as well as other parts of the building like the breakfast area, lobby, and business center.\\n\\nSecurity - This was a pro, althought it was kind of annoying at times.  You need to swipe your room card to access any floor in the building as well as the building its self after 10pm.  This made me feel secure in the hotel, despite the sketchy neighborhood.\\n\\nShuttle - Although we didn\\'t take advantage of this service, Cova offers an hourly shuttle to a few places like Union Square and Fisherman\\'s Wharf.  Space is limited so you want to call down to the desk to make a reservation for the shuttle.  Its a nice alternative if you don\\'t have a car, don\\'t want to take public transit, or a taxi.  \\n\\nCons:\\n\\nNeighboorhood - I knew ahead of time that it wasn\\'t a great neighborhood, but understood that it wasn\\'t particularly dangerous inside the hotel.  If you want to be able to explore the area around your hotel at night (or any time really) without being approached by a homeless person, this is not the hotel for you.  We had a car and planned to not spend much time at the hotel so the neighborhood wasn\\'t much of an issue.  We did have an incident of someone setting off very loud fireworks outside the building across the street in the middle of the night.  We woke up thinking it was gun fire!  Thankfully it wasn\\'t, but it was quite the scare for a few moments.  \\n\\nBuilding issues - The building itself has some features that don\\'t appear to be up to building code.  The ceilings are pretty low in the hallway, and there doesn\\'t seem to be any ventilation at all in the hallway.  There was always a bit of an odd smell walking down the hall which smelled like stale air.  The rooms also have strange HVAC issues.  Most people wouldn\\'t notice this, but my fiancee is an HVAC engineer and noticed it right away.  The balcony sliding door always steamed up when we took a shower, so it was pretty noticable.  \\n\\nParking - Parking is discounted by staying at the hotel, and we didn\\'t have an issue with it really.  It is convienent for us and the attendants were all pretty nice.  The only issue I had was that it was valet only and was a seperate company, not associated with the hotel.  I would have liked the option to self park, but its a minor complaint.  We also had to hold onto a blue ticket for the duration of our stay and present it everytime we wanted our car.  This is fine but it became a little hard to keep track of.

OUT/com/60713/1119270/26010274.html,Cova Hotel,"""Hello Everyone!\\nI have had the great fortune of discovering a newly renovated hotel located in the heart of San Francisco called the COVA HOTEL.  I stayed here last month and was so impressed that I booked it again for my weeks stay.  Why am I so impressed with the COVA? Read on. First, I must compliment the staff.  They really go above and beyond to make the stay comfortable, fun, and personable.  Check in is a breeze. Five minutes or less and you don\\'t have to really wait until 3pm unless they are totally full.  Now the rooms: SPACIOUS and VERY VERY CLEAN!!!  The beds are very comfortable.  I dont know what type of mattress but it is certainly well above average.  The feather duvet is an added bonus of comfort.  They also have these lovely blue throws to keep warm in the comfy chair by these HUGE floor to ceiling windows!  The best part of the room for me are the lovely raw silk drapes. It adds such drama and luxury to the room.  Also, you get the flat screen t.v. with multiple cable channels and my favorite 2 channels, ABC and Travel Channel so I can watch No Reservations and Bizarre Foods. :)  The bathrooms are sleek and modern with a cool round sink, deep bathtub, and nice peppermint toiletries. Refreshing. The mornings are nice because they serve a lovely continental breakfast with fresh homemade waffles (made to order!!!!!!), hard boiled eggs, cereals, juices, bagels, croissants, yogurts,fruit and noodles for those who enjoy an Asian taste. I do think this is one of the best damn continental breakfasts of any hotel.  The magic words here are: FRESH! FRESH! FRESH!......oh, and FREE!!!  One more thing about the breakfast room......its on the top floor and you get the most amazing panoramic views of San Francisco.  Try to go very early at 7am so that you can see the sun rising. Lovely.  I really could go on and on about this place.  They also provide a free shuttle and parking. Free Wi-fi and FREE BUSINESS CENTER with printers! One thing that you might want to consider is that in San Francisco there are a number of homeless.  Honestly, if you have ever been to any big city then its just another thing.  They are quite friendly and non-threatening.  The COVA is quite secure and they have insured this with security keys that restricts floors and so on. Hmmm, trying to think of more things I can say.  If your in San Francisco and want a very comfortable, clean, and fun atmosphere, then the Cova Hotel is your bet!!  OH, the price.  So far since its off peak season, under $100 and they have informed me that it does not go up that much more during peak season. So I think  this is one of the best values in the city.  Have fun in San Francisco!  I sure did!!!!!",5,positive

We got a great deal for the weekend and were able to book the room for less than $90 a night for a Standard Room on a high(er) floor (4th) overlooking the city. The hotels design is great. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The room and bathroom were spacious, remodeled, and very clean. The beds were okay. Free wi-fi access is always a plus. Free breakfast on the top floor was perfect to catch a small bite to eat before sightseeing. The location in terms of closeness to everything is great! Only 4-5 blocks from the center of everything. The only downside, that  4 to 5 blocks turns VERY sketchy. Many homeless/druggies hang out in the area though taking a bus or shuttle is very easy. The hotel advises taking a less direct route two blocks over for safety reasons. Im sure the &quot;Sketchy&quot; people rarely ,if ever, give any people problems, its just not something people enjoy being around. Despite the area, we were VERY pleasantly surprised (for under $100/night we werent expecting the St. Regis) and we knew what to expect with the area. Overall GREAT stay and value- would recommend to anyone. Stay here if you aren\\'t bothered by seeing homeless people everywhere, then again, its San Francisco, they are everywhere!!!",4,positive

However, this hotel is let down by its location...\\n\\nThe Hotel staff are the most helpful, kindest and friendliest hotel staff we have ever had the pleasure of speaking with. The two that we spoke to the most were Lawrence and Christian (we think that they are the names). They we there from day one helping us with everything that we needed to know. One time, the free shuttle bus was over booked so they paid for a taxi for us :) \\nAll of the other members of staff were equally as helpful. The hotel was very clean and safe to be in. Everything in the room worked, it was spacious and quiet. The rooftop never seemed to get used but we thought that it was a brilliant place to chill out if you didn\\'t want to leave the hotel. \\n\\nThe one single downside to the hotel is the location. It is in an area known as the Tenderloin. This is one of the most deprived areas I\\'ve ever been in and to be honest, it was scary. In fact, we made sure that we didn\\'t come back to the hotel when it was too dark. The hotel staff are aware of this and give great directions to avoid the worst part (head north up Hyde and east down Geary street). Avoid walking south of hotel if you can. One day was walked through it to get to the Civic metro line and it was like walking through a prison playground. However, on the way back we got off 2 stops late and walked along Geary street, which was a lot better. \\n\\nPlease consider staying at this hotel but be aware of the places to avoid.",4,positive

The staff were friendly, the room was clean and for me the continental breakfast was adequate. The location itself my not be the most exclusive part of town but you\\'re literally talking a couple of blocks on Ellis Street, after that things improve. I did my homework so I knew what I was letting myself in for. San Francisco nowadays seems to have a huge homeless problem and a lot seem to live in this area but they don\\'t bother when you walk past and seem to keep to themselves.\\n\\nThe hotel also has a complimentary shuttle that you can use to get to some of the major tourist attractions although I never used it as I like to explore cities on foot. There are also plenty of food/restaurant options in the area, Westfield Shopping Mall is only a few blocks away as is the Cable Car for those that don\\'t fancy a hilly walk across town.",4,positive

Vivian even came in on her day off on the day of the event to make sure everything was available for us. It was a nice hotel, the rooms were clean, and the location is close to Union Square (with available free shuttle services).

OUT/com/60713/1119270/186206430.html,Cova Hotel,"""We chose this hotel because of its value for money and it\\'s location only a few blocks from Union Square. We didn\\'t hire a car and needed to be quite centrally located for transport. We read the reviews of the hotel before hand so we knew that the Tenderloin neighbourhood was not the safest or nicest area but the hotel shuttle van makes this fact mostly irrelevant. Being from a city myself I only felt mildly uncomfortable walking this area but my husband who is from the country, felt very uncomfortable, and we ended up only walking from the hotel twice and took the free shuttle every other time. \\nThe shuttle van goes almost every hour to Union Square and a few times a day to Fisherman\\'s Wharf. From Union Square it\\'s a very short walk to the Powell St BART, the F Line Muni and the Cable Car. We went to a 49ers game at Candlestick Park and we caught the 89 bus (only runs on game days), a few streets from Union Square as well, so overall the location proved to be a big positive. \\nThe hotel itself is quite basic. It\\'s clean, it\\'s comfortable and the rooms are really spacious but apart from the breakfast and hotel shuttle there aren\\'t many other facilities or services. The staff are really friendly and very helpful. They will help you book or plan any activities and tell you the good places to eat etc. \\nThe breakfast is fairly basic - they provide juice, tea, coffee, cereal, toast, waffles, fruit and some cold meats and cheese. The views from the breakfast room and rooftop are fantastic. \\nWe recommend The Cheesecake Factory at the top of the Macy\\'s building at Union Square (awesome views and food!) and Super Duper burgers (2 of these on Market Street one is near the Target store) if you want to eat American style food. And also FarmerBrown (cnr Market &amp; Mason) for breakfast does a fantastic buffet with real soul food - collared greens, biscuits and gravy as well as bacon and pancakes etc. \\nIf you want to stay in a central location near Union Square, and just need a comfortable bed to sleep in, and want to save your money for sight-seeing and shopping then the Cova is a great option.

We spent most of the time with other friends in the city, anyway.\\n\\nMY EXPERIENCE--\\n6 of us total.\\n2 nights.\\n\\nDriving up:\\nThis was a bit of a setback for us because, if I can recall, they only had valet parking available so it was around $22-25 a night. Ouch. My party and I split it, but still. We stayed 2 nights and any more than that would have killed me.\\n\\nRoom:\\nWe stayed in a double room with 2 standard beds (or queen...can\\'t remember). The actual room was very clean and enough space for the 6 of us. We decided to push the two beds together to make a giant bed that we all could sleep on. Not sure if we were allowed to, but the beds had wheels, so we did it and it worked just fine for us. We made sure to move everything back the way we found it.\\nThere was also a really nice view of the city! We were able to open up the balcony door, but the balcony ledge looked about 9 or 10 inches...probably not meant for standing on. But we were able to do it anyway.\\nThe bathroom was spacious enough for us as well. There was a flat screen tv, iPod/radio speakers, desk, and chair also in the room. Overall, the entire room was really a lot better than we expected. The furniture was nice, the beds were comfy, and there were six of us in that room. It was perfect for us.\\n\\nHotel/staff:\\nContinental breakfast every morning = waffles, cereal, muffins, cup o\\' noodles, other various foods that I can\\'t remember = yum. All served on the top floor of the hotel. Very nice view.\\nThe staff we did interact with were really friendly. When we were waiting in the lobby, I overheard the concierge going through a map with a few guests, telling them how to walk to Union Square and what streets were the safe ones, and which ones they should avoid.\\n\\nPrior to booking this hotel, I did a lot of research. I read a lot of reviews so I knew this wasn\\'t the safest/cleanest part of town. Since there were 6 of us, we were all fine with it because we stuck together. For a family or couple, I\\'m not sure this would be too appealing or something they would wanna deal with.\\n\\n---\\n\\nPros:\\n+ Price. Can\\'t remember what we paid, but it was cheap compared to hotels nearby.\\n+ Location. Definitely walkable to Union Square.\\n+ Rooms. Clean and big enough for six people to be comfortable.\\n+ Continental breakfast. Need I say more?\\n\\nCons:\\n- Parking. This was the biggest upset. I would give the hotel 5 stars otherwise, but this really hurt my wallet.\\n- Surrounding location. We didn\\'t encounter any bothersome people standing around, but if you\\'re walking with less than 2 or 3 people, I would be wary.",4,positive

The bed looked like a king of super king in size with clean white linen, a big bolster cushion and a large cosy blanket at the foot of the bed.  The furniture was modern and well considered.  I liked that the furniture was variations of dark wood with green soft furnishings with gave the room a very natural and relaxed feel.\\n\\nHome comforts included a wall mounted TV, coffee machine, clock radio (with USB charging ports) and ample surfaces (desk, Chesterfield bench and large bedside tables).  There were plug sockets available throughout the room for easy charging of electronics.\\n\\nThis is not a room where you could ever feel like you were climbing over each other to get around.  You can feel together when you want and take up your own private space when you prefer.\\n\\nThe bathroom:\\n\\nI liked that the bedroom was carpeted for warmth and softness underfoot, and that the hall area and bathroom had laminate flooring.\\n\\nI felt there were lots of handy amenities whilst still leaving the room open and spacious.  I loved that the bath/shower included large containers of shampoo, shower gel and conditioner.  Usually in other hotels, you might get an all-in-one style shampoo/conditioner or a two-in-one shampoo conditioner.  I loved that they were all separate and that the were contained in slick, wall mounted canisters for easy dispensing and use.\\n\\nThe natural feel of the d\\u00e9cor continued into the bathroom with bamboo style trays/containers including tissues, travel kit with shower cap and hairdryer.  I like a large bath sheet for my body and a smaller towel to wrap around my wet hair. The number of towels available in the room was generous which was another thing I was pleased about.  Other hotels sometimes offer a minimal number of towels which can be annoying when there are two people staying in the room.  \\n\\nBreakfast:\\n\\nI thought the staff were well presented, friendly and welcoming.  \\n\\nWe were given vouchers to use to get breakfast upon each day of our stay.  Breakfast starts nice and early at 6:30am and continues through to 9:30am.  The breakfast room was accessed by coming out of the main door of the hotel and going to the left, where there was a large restaurant area with buffet breakfast on offer.\\n\\nThere was a good selection on offer including cereals, juices, fruit, sliced meats, eggs, cheese, bagels, bread, granola pots, muffins and spreads.  \\n\\nReception area:\\n\\nThis was decorated to a modern, high standard with lots of clean, modern and comfortable cushioned seating, newspapers and magazines for reading.

The reception staff were always approachable and pleasant.  \\n\\nI noticed there was both step and separate ramp access into the hotel and breakfast area.  The doors were not automated, however.\\n\\nI would look forward to staying here again.  The pricing was very reasonably for such a high class hotel.

You will be at union square most of your time.There are many homeless people but they do not bother you. The area however is very dirty and has unpleasant odours compared to the rest of San Fransisco. We walked to union square almost daily. The first day some guy took a piss right in front of my family while walking to Union Square.. Some people may feel uncomfortable walking around the neighbourhood, we did sometimes. Reminder they do have a complimentary shuttle but has specific times. Also a taxi is about only 8 dollars, uber may be cheaper.\\n\\nBreakfast:\\nIs average, Try going at 9pm, so that you can get a table during the busier hours. Nothing special. Food runs out fast. Plates, bowls, knives forks and cups also run out fast, but they restock, you may have to ask once or twice although.\\n\\nStaff:\\nVery friendly staff, will help you out. Although honourable mention to Latoya at front desk and Kenisha at breakfast. Kenisha was the best she helped us out so much during breakfast going the extra mile when things ran out, saving the strawberry jam for us and alway serving with a smile.\\n\\nHousekeeping:\\nHad a bad experience with housekeeping, one day they forgot to change our sheets. Talked to front desk and had that figured out. Although houskeeping not upto the standards we are used to. \\n\\nIn conclusion,\\nThe hotel is not bad for the price. They can\\'t do anything about the area but the complimentary shuttles were appreciated. Breakfast was average. Service was good. Rooms were spacious. If you are coming for leisure although I would recommend staying at either fishermans wharf or maybe even closer to union square but it will get pricey. The area the hotel is in I would say is the dirtiest part of San Fransisco. Don\\'t get the red bus tour from the hotel we got it from union square and paid 40 dollars with the &quot;deluxe bus&quot; tour for two days rather than 75 dollars with the hotel.Hotel helped out in booking the alcatraz tour which is a must see. They give complimentary wine which is nice for those who drink.\\n\\nIf I was back in San fransisco would I stay here again?\\n\\nYes if I\\'m on a budget again, but if I have more economic freedom than no just because of the area it\\'s in.",3,negative

The shuttle service to three main destinations was excellent, and a very wise thing for them to provide given the derelict surroundings. Only the faintest of heart need avoid this hotel because of the location, though. We learned that by walking up Polk or Larkin (rather than Hyde) from UN Plaza we could avoid almost all of the unpleasant areas. In big cities we try not to look like tourists and walk purposefully, and, in truth, what we were avoiding here was poverty, rather than anything terrifically dangerous. And to the people who commented on parking being an extra charge--leave your car at home! Parking is always extra in big cities and all of SF\\'s public transportation--BART and the MUNI system (streetcars, busses, cable car)--are available just 4-5 blocks from the hotel in the UN Plaza area.

Despite its older age, the Cova was beautifully renovated, with modern touches in the bathroom and common areas. The lobby was very cozy, complete with plenty of seating and even a lit fireplace. Rooms are furnished with a flat screen HD television, a Keurig coffee maker, and an oscillating fan (also included was a small space heater, but it wasn\\'t necessary.) The front desk staff was accommodating without being overbearing. Daily shuttles take you to many of the local sights (Fisherman\\'s Warf/Pier 39, Union Square, etc), and reserving a spot on the shuttle was painless. Although I wouldn\\'t recommend walking the area at night (although most of the transients were harmless), there are some great food spots nearby, many with hotel delivery options. The roof has a great lounge deck with decent views of the city. Breakfast was complimentary, but nothing special. Breakfast was served in the restaurant next door, but I never saw the restaurant open other times. My advice to you is to save the money you\\'re throwing away on a slightly better view or amenities and try the Cova. The only downside for us was the valet parking ($30/day seemed a bit extreme), but cabs are plentiful and preferable to Uber.",4,positive
OUT/com/60713/1119270/155423255.html,Cova Hotel,"""We chose this hotel for our stay in SF - looking at the photos on the website we thought it would be a decent hotel. \\n\\nThe first issue was the location. It is in a really rough part of town. Directly opposite is a project building where there were people looking directly over into the rooms from the stairwell. We walked past about 5 drug deals on our way to the hotel, a number of prostitutes, homeless people and a man throwing up in the street. This already made us feel uncomfortable and I grew up in a rough area myself! When I go on vacation I want to go somewhere comfortable and pretty. If you love views of the rough side of life, maybe you\\'ll like this place.\\n\\nAlso the room we booked was a \\'Superior Double\\' - ended up as a twin room (two small beds) which was not big enough for us to share as a couple.\\n\\nOn a positive note, the staff were really friendly and lovely. Just a shame that the hotel itself is in a really bad location and the rooms are also quite tatty and run down.\\n\\nIn the end we had to check out and book another hotel in the area. We didn\\'t end up staying the night. That is how bad it felt to us. - check out my other reviews, I know this review may be a bit \\'alarmist\\' in places but I\\'ve stayed at a number of hotels and never had to check out and not stay in one before this trip.

The bed was comfy and made up daily. \\n\\nThe location was a problem for us. We arrived late at night and planned to take public transport from the airport to Union Square and then walk (10 mins) from there to the hotel. Upon reading reviews on TripAdvisor about the problem with homeless people in the vicinity of the hotel, we decided to take a taxi instead. So glad we did. There seems to be a real issue with homelessness in this area and although this is completely out of the hotels\\' control, it is very off-putting for tourists. The hotel offers a free shuttle service to Union Square and Fishermans Wharf but only at certain times and it\\'s virtually impossible to book a place unless you plan your itinerary days in advance. We tried to book the shuttle every evening for the following day (we weren\\'t exactly picky with times either) but every service was already full. There was also one service unavailable because there was no driver. This could really do with improving by either offering more frequent services or perhaps purchase a larger bus? As stated we didn\\'t get chance to take a ride but the mini-bus only seemed to seat maybe 6-8 people. \\n\\nWe were pleasantly surprised that breakfast was complementary to all guests and looked forward to the convenience of this every morning, however we were wholly disappointed with what was on offer. The only good thing was the tea &amp; coffee and perhaps the waffle station. The remainder of the food selection was quite frankly just bizarre. Cold turkey/ham and cheese, bread (stale because it was left uncovered) with no toasting facility, boiled eggs and stodgy porridge. Why not just offer a simple selection of cereals, fruit and pastries instead? Also the dining room was much like a school canteen, something you\\'d expect to see in a hostel rather than a hotel. That being said, the staff were very pleasant and cheerful which was nice to see. \\n\\nThe reception staff were also helpful giving us ideas on where to go and what to see and providing directions etc. The only qualm we had was that upon requesting a late check-out as our ongoing flight was very late, we were told it was possible but it would cost an extra $120. What on earth? We politely declined and were able to store our luggage in the hotel storeroom whilst we went out exploring before taking the shuttle to the airport. \\n\\nOverall we were less than impressed with the hotel but we still enjoyed our stay in San Francisco.

We chose the Cova because it\\'s reasonable walking distance to the Hilton, serves a daily breakfast (lines can be long for that in SF restaurants) and the price was right. The hotel itself has a modern minimalist lobby and our room was comfortable enough (though a heavy duvet seems like overkill for mild SF weather). The breakfasts were adequate, but nothing special - hard-boiled eggs, lukewarm waffles, yogurt with/dried cranberries, granola and occasionally fresh blueberries, and a choice of cereals. The only extraordinary aspect of the breakfast is the chance to eat on the roof, which provides some great views of the city.  Even if you don\\'t eat breakfast, we recommend going to the 8th floor to see the views.\\n\\nWe had read the previous reviews about the neighborhood, but thought that the &quot;dodginess&quot; of the neighborhood simply referred to SF\\'s panhandlers, who have always been numerous in our past visits. I\\'ll be a bit more descriptive because it may help other travelers. I\\'ll start by saying no one on the street bothered us once when we walked to and from our hotel for the entire 5 days. That said, my husband &amp; I (who are fairly young and normally have little fear in urban areas) resolved on the first day to always go to &amp; from the hotel as a couple - never alone.  Everyday on our walk to/from Cova, we\\'d specifically see drug deals, street sex workers, shouting and occasional physical altercations between street people. In the hotel, we would hear occasional shouting at night.  Again, we never had any direct interactions with any of the people who have street turf around the Cova so I don\\'t think they have any interest in the hotel guests, but the neighborhood did make our stay more stressful than relaxing. Yet, one could also say that this was a memorable experience.\\n\\nThere are so many small hotels in San Francisco, that I\\'d definitely make a different choice next time and be sure that we avoid this area of town - even a hotel a few blocks North and East would have made all the difference.",3,negative

With that in mind, there are several homeless  druggies, alcoholics, street walkers etc within very close proximity of the hotel. However, in order to compensate for this the hotel does provide a free shuttle bus to take you to union square and fishermans wharf, which are main tourist attractions and therefore a lot safe for you to catch on going transport to your required destination. We did walk to union square a few times, you just have to go up a block and then walk parallel to Ellis Street so you miss the shelter, this walk is only 10 minutes so not too far from the centre which is great. \\n\\nDespite the location though, this hotel provides great service and the staff are very friendly with lots of information should you require it. The rooms and bathroom are very well sized with fresh clean bed linen. There are lots of complimentary things also including iron, ironing board, towels, shampoo, shower gel etc etc. There is also an information book that the hotel has put together, this is particularly useless for good places to eat etc. The hotel also has very good security, you need a room key in order to enter the lift to get up to the residents floors so no unauthorised persons can enter your landing. \\n\\nBreakfast came with the hotel and it is located in a bistro coming off the hotel in a separate building.

OUT/com/60713/1119270/245053309.html,Cova Hotel,"""Anyone who decided to rate this hotel as \\'poor\\' or \\'terrible\\' are doing it a massive disservice. Which is interesting considering how out of their way the staff make your stay a great one. \\n\\nLets get to the basics; yes, this hotel is not in the best area. Tenderloin is well known for it\\'s homeless community, and if you go out walking at night around the hotel, you may feel unsafe dependent on your disposition. If you are willing to walk a few blocks, however, you will soon be on the road toward Union Square. I would just recommend avoiding Eddy Street, otherwise you are pretty much golden. The homeless community keep themselves to themselves anyway, it is almost the opposite of somewhere like Berlin where you get pestered for money. \\n\\nThe important thing to remember with this hotel and the above comment is that, providing you sign up daily, the free shuttle bus service provided by Cova is absolutely incredible. It is safe, reliable and means you never have to leave your hotel to walk into Union Square or it\\'s surrounding areas. Or if you want to go to Fisherman\\'s Wharf. The sad thing is, homelessness is rampant in San Fran, it is only concentrated in Tenderloin, make no allusions as you will witness it everywhere you go in this city. \\n\\nThe hotel itself has excellent staff, one particular gentleman called Lawrence (I know it is spelled differently, so apologies!) made our first impressions of the place really great. He immediately told us about the area, where to avoid and what to do via a map he gave us. He also went out of his way to explain the amenities, tell us the process about breakfast and the shuttle bus and upgraded us slightly (this was the first stop on our honeymoon before Las Vegas and NYC).\\n\\nThe room was spacious and the bed is VERY comfortable. For those worrying about aircon not being the hotel, there was a very decent fan/heater in our room, and this was more than enough to keep us warm/cool depending, couldn\\'t really tell you if it would be sufficient in the height of summer, however! The noise levels on our floor was quite high, but then I guess that was the clientele rather than the hotel itself. Sleeping was never an issue as the bed was the epitome of comfort!\\n\\nI would say that the shower/bath system is a little broken, as to have a shower you need to pull down on the bath tap (faucet) in order for it to switch over. Problem is, it was a little faulty and would often click back into position, meaning having a bath was a lot easier than it was to have a shower. But then this is a very minor gripe, the room and bathroom where overall very clean and comfortable. Maid service was completely faultless not to mention the maids were very polite and always went out of their way to say hello. Also, I am not sure about the TV variety Americans are used to, but the channel selection seemed very expansive. \\n\\nBreakfast was very nice and a great way for you to start your day. Staff were helpful and friendly in that respect too. \\n\\nOne thing I would say is that there is a bottle of water in the room which we were charged for upon departure. Couldn\\'t see anything to suggest that this would happen and most hotels usually offer water for free, so I think this is a little tight! Perhaps Cova should either give bottled water for free or make it clearer that it will cost. Can understand being charged for a minibar, but a bottle of water?\\n\\nIf you want a personal service to pick you up and drive you to the main places in San Fran, then this is the hotel for you. Staff are great, room is good and the overall stay was very pleasant. Don\\'t be put off by the area issue, as after using the shuttle service once or twice you will totally forget that it exists. \\n\\nA great hotel and a fantastic start to our honeymoon, many thanks to the Cova Hotel.

There are homeless, drug addicts, uncapped hypodermic syringes, human faecaes, people urinating publicly on the streets and drug infested encampments surrounding the hotel. Where there will be groups of 20-30 men loitering outside. It is far from safe particularly for tourists and shows the seedier side of America.

This is one of the very few properties in San Francisco (less than 5% of properties) charging a \\u201cresort fee\\u201d. I find this pretty disingenuous as it allows the hotel to purport a rate which is lower than the final rate the consumer will finally pay as it gets wrapped up beyond the pure room rate which is reported in platforms like Expedia and meta search platforms thus providing an unfair advantage to the hotel for consumers who are searching purely on room rate only. The hotel will justify this by saying they provide additional features for this price which some consumers may not care about such as a free phone call or a bottle of water.\\n\\nThis \\u201cresort fee\\u201d includes access to two bikes in reception, bottled water, an unhealthy snack in the room (peanuts coated in salt and sugar), WiFi, \\u201ccoffee\\u201d and receiving two vouchers for a mule drink in their bar - which is basically light alcoholic ginger beer with a tiny touch of spirits on the top for which you have to deal with an bar tender who doesn\\u2019t know where anything is, and takes a while to serve you in a bar with 2 other people. \\n\\n2/ the room even on the higher floors are noisy you can hear people screaming, doing drug deals down the alley, blaring music at 12am on the streets, street cleaners at 4am.

I arrived around 9pm on the first night and got a room so small I could hardly walk around the bed and no windows. It had a pretend curtain with a wall behind. I asked to move to a room with a window but the hotel was full so I could not move until the next day. \\nThe following day I left my bags in reception and returned the following night to get another room. It had a window but it overlooked KFC and a bus stop and about 20 homeless people jacking up and making a noise that sounded like a scene out of Dawn Of The Dead. It was so loud I thought the window was open but alas not. The room was awful. The air-con and TV controls were missing, literally nowhere to hang your clothes, no cupboards nothing. A prison cell in Alcatraz would have been more comfortable. \\nOnce again I asked to move as the noise was unbelievable. The following day I left my bags in reception, went to work, came back around 9pm only to be given the same room as the night before. I walked out and left. \\nBe warned, this place is awful. \\nPlus it was $215 per night.  It wins the EPIK award as the worst hotel ever.",1,negative

Before leaving Australia i contacted the hotel about the shuttle service they provided. I was emailed by Jeff informing me that yes they provide a shuttle to simply ring them when we land and they will inform us of where to go to be picked up. As instructed i wang the hotel once we landed in San Fransisco only to be told they offer no such thing and we are to take the BART to civic centre then walk from there. I tried to explain that i had arranged for a pick up but was quickly dismissed and told there was no shuttle on offer from that hotel. Once we made our way after a 14 hour flight off the BART the welcome from the guy at reception was less than welcoming. Then to add to the issues of this hotel the day we were due to check out we received n internal call from a guy at the front desk saying that there computers have crashed and our details have been lost. Joe claimed all our information had been lost and that he had to process us manually. He then asked about our personal details and then required our credit card details. Once we started to question this he became aggressive in the way he was talking to me over the phone to the point when i asked again why he needed or credit card details when we had already paid. I became very suspicious and refused to give him our details which then he began to yell at me over the phone. I told him i was coming down stairs to sort this outing i hung the phone up. we went down stairs to find out what was going on to find a woman behind the desk and the computers did not crash overnight. It was a scam as we thought. We informed her of exactly what just happened as the man on the phone rang internally and told us that other guests had been contacted already. When we checked out we asked her did she find out anything only to be told she tried to ring the manager but there was no answer so she will try again later.

At the end the hotel offers a parking service which is 50$/24h. The members of the parking space come to the hotel and park your car (you only give them the key).

It is very spacious compared to most hotels in San Francisco, as well as decently priced. The area it is as though, seemed to be very sketchy. A lot of homeless people and loud music playing outside until midnight and at around 6-7am. Even our Uber driver said that the area was not desirable. The staff at check-in was very nice and helpful, you need to temporarily park in front of the hotel to get your luggage down and check-in. One of the staff members then proceeded to tell me that he will show me where to park. I was under the impression that he would direct me to where to enter to their parking garage, but it turns out that he took me to a public parking garage. He rode in the car with me, got down and spoke with the parking garage attendant. The garage attendant then told me it was $40 to park for the night. I wish he could have told me it was a public pay parking, I could\\'ve just found parking in the street for free because I had a disabled parking permit (I thought they had their own garage and it would be safer), but by that time, my car was already being driven into their underground parking by an attendant. I know parking in San Francisco is not cheap, but I wish I could have just been given a heads-up on where he was taking me. \\n\\nWe only stayed one evening for a doctor\\'s appointment in the area, and at check-out, there was another staff member (perhaps the concierge) that was taking very good care of another family that was loading their car. I was parked right behind them and I saw him loading their suitcases, opening their doors, etc. When he was done and the father of that family was just strapping in their child in the car seat, the concierge just stood there, chatting and waving and waiting, while I was loading my car with my children and our luggage with just my mother, we had no male or bigger person to help us. I really don\\'t care if people didn\\'t help, but I wish he wasn\\'t so obvious with his preferential treatment. The lady at the check-out didn\\'t even ask me how our stay was.\\n\\nI am not one to complain easily am not very picky, but I would not stay at this hotel again.

Hotel32One is in the nice category and I\\'ll refute the naysayers points, one by one \\u2013 1) The front desk attendants were professional, friendly, and nice \\u2013 not sure why so many complaints about staff, because I thought the staff was just fine \\u2013 this ain\\'t the Four Seasons, don\\'t expect a database on you, and a chocolate chip cookie. 2) Claw tubs in baths are a problem \\u2013 really? That\\'s a complaint? I didn\\'t get a claw-foot tub, wish I had, cause they are a classic and worth preserving \\u2013 so you have to step higher to get in and out of the tub shower \\u2013 why would that be a problem? 3) Street noise \\u2013 granted I was on the 8th floor Northwest corner, because I requested an upper floor and they complied, but, it\\'s a city \\u2013 there is going to be street noise \\u2013 every city hotel room has some city noise going on in the background \\u2013 so, not a problem unless you expect it to be as quiet as Hays, Kansas. 4) Homeless people in sketchy neighborhood \\u2013 really? It\\'s San Friggin\\' Francisco! Yep, chalk-full of homeless \\u2013 this isn\\'t exactly The Tenderloin where it seems there are more homeless than residents \\u2013 this neighborhood is practically Mayberry in comparison to The Tenderloin. Enjoy the relative \\'lack\\' of homeless people and get over the fact that there will be crazy homeless people in the vicinity, because America doesn\\'t have much of a social safety net anymore, and has closed nearly all mental institutions and has limited resources to provide for the mentally ill who are, not by choice, homeless, -  SF is one of the better cities for indigent care, and that\\'s why it has so many homeless people. That\\'s not a factor or fault of this particular hotel. So, a non-issue in my review. \\n\\nThe good \\u2013 the property -- and my room \\u2013 1803, were impeccably clean and safe \\u2013 the water pressure in the shower was good, the towels were good, the TV and programming were good, the view was good, the closet and iron and ironing board and electrical outlets \\u2013 all good \\u2013 the free wine in the lobby in the evening \\u2013 very good. \\n\\nThe bad \\u2013 the rug while clean was lower quality than high-end hotels would allow \\u2013 the bed while okay, was borderline not great \\u2013 I had a double bed and it could have been more comfortable than it was. \\u2013 and the sheets were lower quality than I normally enjoy in a hotel.  \\n\\nOverall, would I rate this as one of my better hotel experiences in SF? No. Would I rate it as one of my less than favorable hotels in SF \\u2013 not even close. This hotel is middle to upper road quality, and for the price, worth the middling to upper reality. Would I return to this property? Yes, without any hesitation. And thus, my recommendation to ignore the naysayers in the reviews of this hotel property.

It was pretty nice weather, no rain and not as much wind as other times of the year.

I noticed a lot of care in the folding of the towels and linens and the soap and shampoo was 1st class.\\n\\nThe room\\'s appointments are not 4 star astounding but are nice enough for the price and purpose, I did not come to San Francisco to hang out in the room.  The windows would benefit from cover over the curtain rails and the carpet could be a little nicer but the room is sort of like a classic Chinatown version of a Hampton Inn, value based and not ornate.\\n\\nThe Lobby is sort of different, you walk into the front desk area and then down a hall to the sitting area, not a traditional lobby.  The elevator functioned well, but it is older and a little slow.  \\n\\nThe service was pretty good and the clerks were helpful and well versed on the transportation system and directions.  \\n\\nThe hotel is not air conditioned so with higher tempratures you may be happier in a different place, there are ceiling fans and larger windows that open.  The steam heat works very well so in colder months this place will hit the mark perfectly.\\n\\nI came in by subway so I really don\\'t know what the parking is like but San Francisco has the best American Public Transportation System imaginable so one you\\'re parked don\\'t bother with using the car again.

The tram is well worth the ride to Fishermans Wharf and again you get all sorts of tips from the drivers.\\nThe hotel is sort of on the edge of the Tenderloin and so you will see all sorts of characters, but thats not a reason to be put off., its a buzzy place, maybe thats why people have commented on the noise, we didn\\'t notice this though.\\nIf we returned to SF I would seriously consider staying here again, its a great location to get around, but also gives you an escape from the tourist crowd if you want one.",4,positive

As a frequent patron before the remodel, it is a shock to see the French decor give way to the new minimalist look.  The rooms are pretty white with the two walls covered with mirrors to make the smallish room seem much larger.  Fine quality bedding makes for a luxurious nights sleep.  In keeping with an eco-friendly environment, it is a little dim in the entry way and no light in the closet.\\nThe staff was friendly and helpful, at the front desk, concierge and the front door staff.  The rain interrupted the smooth flow of traffic, and we had 20 minute waits both to drop off our car and to retreive it.  Everyone was working hard and helpful, but the infrequent rains in San Frnacisco seemed to overwhelm them.\\nThe main dining room was fabulous.  The unusual blend of Asian and Cuban cuisine was delicious and presented boldly with lots and lots of food.  Our waiter was friendly, knowledgeable and helpful -- especially about not ordering too much as the portions were huge.  The scallops were perfect; our calamari salad was delicious, and we split a main course of steak that was so tender it could be cut with a fork.  \\nThere was a mix-up on our dinner reservation, but they promptly took responsibility and we were seated within 5 minutes on a busy Saturday night.  Everyone was quite pleasant and helpful.\\nOverall, it was an outstanding experience.  Close to Union Square and shopping.

We booked it through Jetsetter, and from the pictures it looked phenomenal. And the lobby and common areas were, but the rooms were pretty mediocre, and the bathrooms were extremely small. Small bathrooms are huge problem when you have a wife who uses a million products and likes to throw clothes all over the place. So that was a negative for us. We couldn\\'t both be in there at the same time it was that small. Size wise, the bedroom was big but the furnishings were a little tired. The halls of the guest room floors were interesting, like you were walking through someone\\'s home. Not as luxurious as I would have liked, but not terrible. \\n\\nThe lobby was really great and had a lot of interesting furniture, including a giant chair that my wife got a great photo in. The lounge was a lot of fun, we went there for a few drinks Saturday night and the crowd was really energetic. They had these really neat &quot;paintings&quot; which were actually videos of the models standing still.

I got an amazing rate, and was pleased when it was confirmed as this hotel. That was just the start. \\n\\nAfter a delayed flight, and not arriving at the hotel until 2am, I was checked in swiftly, and given a room on the 16th Floor. I entered the elevator and it only went to the 16th Floor. (There is a 17th Floor, accessible by a staircase on the 16th, so not entirely the top). \\n\\nMy room, 1602, looked out towards Union Square, and many rooftops. It was however, amazingly quiet, and the room itself huge. Plenty of storage space, table, chairs, comfortable king bed, and reasonable sized bathroom, with a standard soaking tub and a shower over. The in room toiletries were a bonus, and that bar soap, amazing. \\n\\nThe hotel has an amazing bar called the Redwood Room, which, if you want to learn about cocktails, and have a quiet conversation is best visited before 8pm, as it does get busy early. It is a scene, and supposedly a place to be seen at! I went early, had a few beers, great conversation with the bar tenders, and was a bonus to have a great bar in a hotel. However, when the music gets turned up loud, and it is busy, it might not be everyones cup of tea. \\n\\nThe Lobby is reasonably dark, as has been mentioned before, but it isn\\'t so dark you can\\'t see anything. The lifts are unique, with each being a different colour, and once you get to the floor, the corridors are lit perfectly. \\n\\nLocation is great, with a short walk to Union Square, Cable Cars, Bus Routes, MUNI, BART etc. As other people have said, there are homeless in the area, but they are in many areas around San Francisco, but not once did I find any of them agressive, demanding or intimidating. You can choose to politely say no, or just carry on with your life, and they\\'re used to it. Location is everything when exploring a new city, and I couldn\\'t fault the location of the Clift.\\n\\nI can\\'t comment on the staff, as I never needed their assistance, and found the stay in the Clift hotel perfectly acceptable, as it hit the nail on the head for what I wanted and needed for my first trip to San Francisco",5,positive

Seamless service begins outside on Geary Street, where you will be greeted by Clift doormen and bellmen at the top of their game. An efficient, welcoming check-in will afford you a quick trip up one of three dimly luminous elevators to your minimalist chic abode.  \\n\\nMy white duvet greeted me with a provocative Mark Twain quote: &quot;Clothes make the man. Naked people have little or no influence on society.&quot;  Large opposing mirrors at the headboard and wall above a lengthy ottoman lighten and open up the extremely efficient space, and many electrical outlets throughout the room effectuate the simultaneous use of a hairdryer and curling iron, as well as chargers for phone, laptop and camera. \\n\\nTranslucent orange cubes serve as nighstands; a bongo serves as a table for the lavender chair with light wool pashima; lighting is plentiful, peaceful, and well spaced; a large flat screen boasts scores of movie selections; and the large desk which afforded a spectacular view overlooking a spread of Nob Hill rounded out my happy abode.  \\n\\nThe bathroom shower had very good water pressure, the shelf underneath the vanity worked well as extra storage space, and towels and robes were cotton high quality.  While I did not benefit from the much-hyped new mattresses which apparently arrived after my departure, the Clift front desk rushed a mattress topper and special accoutrements to my room when I indicated that I found their old mattresses a tad hard on the Goldilocks scale.  Speaking of fairy tales, be sure to check out the Alice in Wonderland themed huge lobby chair!  \\n\\nThe Clift\\'s halls and elevators emanate a relaxing subdued vibe, as do the public spaces.  The fitness center designer thought of every athletic persuasion possible!  Versatility rules!  Yogis will find a mat and ball, cardio types have access to multiples of most any machine, and weightlifters have their choice of a huge selection of both free weights and versatile machines. Headphones, spring water and towels were nice touches. \\n\\nThough I didn\\'t have time to try the restaurant due to other nighttime events, the redwood bar is phenomenal in decor, energy, and service.  Check it out if only to see th amazing tree that is the bar\\'s namesake.  Two theaters are literally next door neighbors, and the Jean-Paul Satre play I saw one night, No Exit, fit right in with the Clift\\'s unconventional vibe.  The neighborhood, as all of the Union Square area, is home to some seedy types, though I found San Francisco\\'s homeless much more creative than those residing in the Nation\\'s Capital.  I was offered tourist brochures or directions, and even a safe escort back to my hotel in the late evening by some enterprising street people.  Leave them alone, or give them a smiling greeting, and they will do the same.  One is a motionless mime with a cup.  He amazingly doesn\\'t even blink.  Conversely, stores and galleries in the area retail luxury items, and flagship stores of the nation\\'s top brands are within a few blocks of The Clift.  \\n\\nThe best part of this piece of geography is that Geary street is flat!  You won\\'t have to constantly negotiate the huge hills upon which sit the other Union Square west hotel properties, unless you have events there, of course.  Heeled ladies such as myself should plan on bringing some flats for mountaineering and a bag large enough to transport the heels.  Don\\'t want to mar those stilettos :)  \\n\\nBe sure to check out North Beach, home to the Beatnik Museum and City Lights Bookstore, as well as the National Shrine of St. Francis of Asisi, housing a 3/4 replica of Asisi\\'s chapel.  The restaurants there are uniformly authentic Italian, and the gelato is superb.  Be sure to find the ultra cool, and little known, Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Factory on unassuming Ross Alley in Chinatown that\\'s worth discovering; you\\'ll be the only one bringing home chocolate and strawberry fortune cookies.

I was given a king-size bed room on the 8th floor.\\n\\nWhen I reached my room, I found the room was small, cozy. Nevertheless, it was comfortable and manageable. The room is filled with floor to ceiling mirrors to create the illusion of a bigger room. The decor was nicely furnished with interesting design choices. For example, the bedside dressers were orange translucent cubes. The bathroom was clean and well stocked with towels and toiletries. I noted that the room did not have a coffee maker or ice bucket.

If it weren\\'t for my research here on Trip Advisor, I would not have known that the hotel has a gym facility.\\n\\nAs the hotel building is U-shape, my room was facing another room of the other leg of the U-shape.

We had originally booked a double room but were put into a room with small twin beds that was next to the noisy elevators and looked like it was in major need of a fresh coat of paint or deep clean.  Not getting your choice of room is understandable when it\\'s busy but it was the arrogant, unhelpful attitude we received from the front desk when we asked to move that we found most upsetting.  The walls were as thin as paper (we woke up constantly with the elevator binging, people talking, trolleys going past - we\\'re young and were out every evening so don\\'t think we had unreasonable expectations), the room was really dated, dowdy and depressing - especially the bathroom.

I have stayed at many Kimpton properties like the Hotel Monaco right down the street but I wanted to try something new.  The reviews and pictures on tripadvisor were good but I was worried about some comments that the bathrooms were small.  But other comments like the cleanliness of the hotel and the design led me to book it for two nights after a work conference ended (and I stayed at the Hilton, a giant conference hotel).  \\n\\nAnyway the Clift is right in the heart of Union Square and there\\'s a Walgreens and a Starbucks across the street within a very short walking distance, less than a block.  Very helpful.  \\n\\nThe hotel had a minibar in the room.  The bathrooms were NOT too small, they were very functional and the tub was a deep tub and the hot water and shower were great!  I am picky, picky and this hotel more than met my expectations.  Others posting on here are right about the cleanliness--I moved the curtains in a couple different places to plug in chargers and my laptop, and I\\'ll tell you what, there was NO DUST.  YOu know how baseboards get grimy?  The baseboards in this hotel were cleaner than my house.  The room was CLEAN.  I really appreciated that.  I never saw housekeeping but I tipped them well because they deserve it for the good work they are doing.  You can tell when housekeeping doesn\\'t care, and the housekeeping staff at this hotel does care and is doing a great job.\\n\\nThe design of the room was great.  I loved the colors and the extremely modern and peaceful vibe.  The bed linens were wonderful, high thread count, spotless white, and housekeeping smoothed my bed into an oasis of perfection.  When I came back from a full day of walking and shopping and saw my peaceful, perfect room, I was so happy.  \\n\\nThe front desk staff was highly attentive and friendly.  When I asked where to print out my boarding pass, the desk clerk immediately got on her computer and printed it for me without being asked.  I would have been happy to do it myself.  \\n\\nI didn\\'t have time to visit the Redwood Room, another reason to go back.  The lobby was lovely.  Each elevator is a different color- purple, red, and green.  You\\'ll see, they are really cool.  Lots of trendy people coming and going, some bachelorettes, some hip couples, businessmen who spoke French, that\\'s the vibe.  And I liked it!  : )  Even with the possibility of mayhem due to the party look of the crowd, my room was QUIET and I got a great sleep. I came very early in the day and stored my bags, and the clerk offered me a room on the second floor, but thanks to other tripadvisor posters, I asked to wait and get a higher floor.  I think this was very good advice, as I stopped by later and ended up on the 11th floor where it was silent.  Wide hallways, monchromatic color scheme.  Really neat.\\n\\nI liked that the windows in the room open.  I loved the paint color in the room so much I wanted to ask what it was, but forgot.  The TV was great, free HBO.  There was a safe in the room, which was nice.  Easy to get online, although its $14.95 a day for internet service.

It was self service on each floor, with a variety of orange juice, assortment of freshly baked bread and cakes, fruits, and coffee, cocoa, tea etc. In addition, there was an all-day choice of tea and coffee at the reception area which was a nice touch. \\nAlso we had a voucher for a complimentary glass of wine at their restaurant, Fino. Also, wi-fi was also complimentary anywhere in the hotel. Little things that make the difference. Therefore I recommend this hotel because with the price we achieved from Hotwire it proved to be an excellent choice.",4,positive
OUT/com/60713/112320/45506134.html,Andrews Hotel,"""Today I have returned from a four week trip through the west of the United States. San Francisco was my last stop before travelling home to The Netherlands. I stayed in the Andrews Hotel in Post Street. I choise this hotel because it is only two blocks away from Union Square. The hotel is in a very old building and the rooms are extremely small and the bathroom was tiny. The paint is coming of the walls and the hotel is in desperate need of renovation or maybe even closure. You could hardly move around in the room or in the bath. A typical hostel room in the center of a big city. The staff was friendly enough and there was a glass of complementary wine everyday in the Vino restaurant adjacent to the hotel. The hotel was quite expensive ($139 a night in the weekend and $129 during the week) for the services that they offered and the size of the room, but most hotels in San Francisco are ridiculously overprized. There are many tourists, so they can get away with it. There is a free breakfast that you can take to your room, but it isn\\'t worth getting up for. There is no free internet and that is quite remarkable for any hotels or motel in the USA. I stayed in the Andrews for four nights. The first two nights I slep in room 706. After the first night, I saw two little red bites of my skin. Because I had been to Montery the day before, I thought that they were sandfly bites and didn\\'t react. But after the second night I had a least twenty bites all over my body. A close inspection of the sheets led to the cause. There were crawling with bedbugs. I went down to reception imediately and had the sheets changed and I reported the bedbug situation. They changed me to another room and the last two nights no more bites appeared. The reception informed me that after the sheets were changed, a new inspection was carried out and there was no further cause for alarm. The manager would speak to me next day (Monday) between 11:00 and 12:00 am. I waited in the lobby for his arrival, but he didn\\'t turn up. No reason was given. The next day one hour before my departure for the airport, he did knock on my door. He was very apologetic and told me that he took the bedbug problem very serious. He also informed me that many hotels in San Francisco had a problem with bedbugs. He offered to take one of the four nights of the bill and to have my bagage fumigated. But that would have been helpful a day earlier, but now I had to depart for the airport and had no time left to have my bagage cleaned. So, on getting home from the airport, I washed all my clothes using high temperatures. And I have this itching and am scratching in a least a dozen places. I will have this reminder of my stay in the Andrews for the next couple of weeks. Although this can happen to any hotel, I think I will prevent the Andrews hotel the next time I am in San Francisco. I think I will stay in a more luxurious hotel from no on. After all, I have paid a four star price for a two star accommodation this time and I am regretting my choice. A better hotel will not cost a lot more and the risk of meeting the little pests in your bed is probably lower.",2,negative
OUT/com/60713/112320/114982093.html,Andrews Hotel,"""I have been meaning to write this for a while. (I did write an outline with a week of my return so my thoughts were easily refreshed ) I really didn\\'t know what or how I was going to choose a hotel on my visit to san fran as I have never been their and know little of the city beside what I have read. Plus I am really not a hotel person, I travel alone and have spent quite a few nights sleeping in a car on the side of the road when pushing for a destination. But obviously a hotel was what I needed  and I could not have made a better choice. Cheap, comfortable, good service, decent beds and resonably quiet for a city hotel. (my place at home is actually noisier).\\n\\nThe big plus was the price during the week in may 2010. For what I paid under $100 I thought I recieved great value. The rooms are small but for one person to sleep in at night and research the next day of travels online, it was perfect. When returning after a 3 days excursion south I booked a day in advance for a sat. night and the room was smaller and tighter and $160/night. But I booked late so.... .  I went to Santa Cruz on the weekend and stayed at a Best Western which was pretty new and the room cost almost 2.5x as much. I was almost in shock at how big after the andrews. I almost set up a bowling alley or thought of running laps. But I the space really had no use for me and would have been happy with an Andrews size room and price.  \\n\\nService was pretty good. I had issues accessing a printer and ice The printer is a function of who is working the front desk and their computer ability. The ice is in the service area in the basement and is only accessible by staff at night. During the day it is easily accessed. Since their are no fridges in the rooms I just wanted access to cold fluids during my time in the room. Ice in a 5 gal bucket refreshed daily would have been fine but it just didn\\'t happen partially because of timing and not sure if I was asking too much. \\n\\nLocation wise it was great. It\\'s really close to union square, lots of shopping. Your six blocks from Powerl and Market st where you can pretty much catch any transit unit you like. Or should I say you can get off the BART which you took in from the Airport and your six blocks from your hotel. It is uphill but even for me a walk aphobe it wasn\\'t a far walk. Just look at a map on the way in and get your bearings. The cable car turnaround (or track end) is at the bottom of powel  Follow the car  up the powel to the hill and Union Square. First left after Union Square or Victoria Secret or the Westin St. Francis where VS is  part of is Post Street.  Two and a half blocks up Post on the other side of the street is the Andrews. The transit system can pretty take you anywhere you want to go. Just don\\'t expect to use cable cars as a mode of transport during the tourist season. Unless you like waiting in very long line ups. In may I used it about 8 am no problem but by noon the lines on the other end were pretty long on Fishermans wharf.",4,positive

While the lobby is small and dated it is comfortable and the front desk is friendly and helpful.  The hotel is approximately 5-6 blocks from Union Square, a high end shopping area.  The hotel provides a convenient continental breakfast on each floor and I\\'ve slipped out in my PJs on several occasions to prepare my morning coffee to take back to the room.  While the neighborhood is not too safe after dark for a single female to walk, the adjoining restaurant makes it easy to grab dinner and never leave the hotel.  There is free wifi on each floor but I\\'ve found that it slows down during peak times - I usually end up using mifi on my phone during those times.  The hotel does not have air conditioning which is not typically a problem.  However, if you want to open your windows to allow the chilly night breeze in you may want to request a room on floor 6 or 7 to get up from the street noise that goes on most of the night.  I also use a white noise app on my phone.

If you like modern and homogenous then stay elsewhere. I am a poor sleeper and was worried about city noise but not a problem as it was relatively quiet on the 7th floor - the only noise coming part way through my long weekend when a noisy woman in the opposite room was only capable of slamming her door and using her mobile in the hallway but there we go - hotels can\\'t be responsible for fellow travellers breach of etiquette.  This hotel is in an ideal location on Post Street with Union Square, shops and cable cars in close proximity.

Yes, the bathroom is small, but when you stay in a property built in 1905, that is what is to be expected.  The charm of the hotel, rooms and furnishings far outweighed the issues with a small bathroom.   We would have given this a rating of 5 with the exception of 2 small issues.  It was difficult to adjust the temperature (radiator heat), and unfortunately we stayed in San Francisco during a rainy, cold week.  However, it was easy to turn on/off, but when on, it was very hot.  So, no problem, we cracked a window occasionally when needed.  We had issues with our key cards working when we first arrived, but the staff at the desk were very patient and helpful and quickly resolved the issue.

Basically all the transportation that you\\'ll need to reach every corner of San Francisco.\\n\\nRECEPTION: I found the reception staff very helpful and nice.\\n\\nROOM: My room was on the 6th floor. Let\\'s start saying that the room was EXTREMELY hot when I got there, but I turned down the radiator, opened a little bit the window and was better. The window, however, was very stiff to open and close.

I used the room service from them one night and even if the quality of the food was not bad I found the price a little bit too expensive... The breakfast is not served in the restaurant, it will get served on a counter on your floor.

We had hoped to spend it at the Chancellor (see the reviews there), but could not get them on consecutive nights.  So, based on TA reviews we chose The Andrews.\\n\\nFirst, the good news:  the continental breakfast pastries are superb.  Seriously, the pastries are holy-moly good.  The location is within a few blocks of Union Square.  The rates are very reasonable.  Plus, you get a free glass (of quite good wine, BTW) each night.  So, what\\'s not to like?\\n\\nWell, first of all, the noise from a nearby nightclub/restaurant nearby will keep anyone up, even if they\\'re not a light sleeper. People stagger out for a smoke, well liquored-up, and converse at the top of their lungs.  Then, in the early AM, the garbage scows troll by with all sorts of racket.\\n\\nThe rooms are very small (and we opted for the &quot;comfortable queen&quot;).   In chatting with one of the guests over the free glass of wine, we discovered we were lucky....her room was even smaller.  Lastly, we were there in February, and the room was HOT.  We opened both of the available windows (one in the bath, the other in the main sleeping area) and it kept the room tolerable, at best.   Importantly, there is no air conditioning in the rooms; heaven knows how hot it must get in the summer.  Our room was also dimly lit. \\n\\nThe hotel is in bad need of an update.  The carpeting in the halls is well-worn and well-stained.  The appointments in the rooms are sorely dated, and not well-suited to 21st travelers.  The shaker-style desks are super-small with barely enough room for one laptop, and lack adequate outlets (we ended up unplugging the DVD player, to snag another port), and the Wi-Fi is problematic at best.  \\n\\nIt\\'s certainly not a flea bag, and it does have its merits.  Plus, its restaurant, Fino, is superb.  But it\\'s still not as good as other options nearby.  If you go into your reservation knowing its limitations, you won\\'t be disappointed.

It has the original elevator, which by itself will be a new experience for most people: the door operates manually and swings open, like a room door (albeit a somewhat heavier than usual one). There is no air conditioning (probably not an issue given San Francisco\\'s climate); my room had a large ceiling fan over the bed, which kept the climate sufficiently comfortable. The TV was actually a computer monitor, which was okay if you watched from the desk chair but might have been a bit small if you tried to watch from the bed.\\n\\nThe bathroom was not a place for claustrophobes or sumo wrestlers. When you opened the door, you faced the sink, with the toilet on your right (facing toward the sink) and the shower on your left. From the doorway to the mirror behind the sink was about three feet; from the wall of the shower to the wall behind the toilet was about 12 feet.

We had a petite suite and due to the fact my travel buddy doesn\\'t go to bed till at least 4am and gets up at 12 noon and I rise at 8 or 9am this worked really well for us.  In a morning I was able to wake up and go into the next room to work on my laptop, watch TV or eat breakfast, all without waking hime up!\\n\\nHaving stayed with my buddy before I am used to note getting the rooms made up because he sleeps so long, not so at the Andrews!  We had the suprise of our lives on the second day when we were only out of the hotel for 15 minutes to get some food and then return to get ready for the day only to find the room had been done.  \\n\\nThe bathroom was of a good size and I felt comfortable in the cleanliness of the hotel to actually use the bathtub (something I wouldn\\'t usually do in a hotel!).\\n\\nThe front desk staff were always friendly helpful and happy to give advice at any point day or night.  I had only one minor issue during our stay and that was the free internet was off for two-three days while they upgraded there system.  It would have been nice to have been informed, just a little note under the door would have been appreciated.  That being said it was only a minor fault and one the hotel more than made up for.\\n\\nI\\'m very glad I found this hotel and if I get the opportunity to return to San Fransisco I\\'ll be back for sure.",5,positive

We could easily hear all the traffic and noisy revelers from the bars etc!! We changed our rooms to something in the middle of floor (room 704) and that was the quietest possible. The staff was very accomodating and helpful. There was no problem with hot water or anything else. Decent breakfast as advertised. Had a decent PInot Grigio and white Zin at Fino (complimentary).

In the past, I always wondered about staying at The Andrews Hotel based on its website description and traveler reviews but the price was a deterrent for me as a budget traveler. So when I saw the price during my scheduled stay, I was surprised but gratefully relieved. I booked my reservation online, as I always do whenever I fly or choose my lodging.  \\n\\nMy request for early check-in was honored with an upgrade to a queen bedroom when a double room was unavailable.\\n\\nMy hotel stay was pleasant and comfortable. I enjoyed my room\\'s decor and facilities, including the walk-in closet. The bathroom was a little tight but it had a bathtub and adequate shelf space. I was able to open the window in the main room to let in some cool breeze especially when it felt a little stuffy and warm due to controlled heat. There was an overhead ceiling fan so that was helpful, too.\\n\\nAlthough I spent 12-hr. days exploring the city, I liked relaxing in my room at the end of my day. There was TV and DVD but I primarily had the TV on. Although there was cable, I was disappointed that it didn\\'t have the ESPN channel. But that\\'s really a minor critique.\\n\\nI enjoyed breakfast served in the hallway - hot water, coffee, orange juice, assortment of mini breads/pastries, fruits (bananas, apples, oranges) ,bags of hot chocolate and tea, with jelly, sugar cubes and milk. I brought my breakfast selection back to my room in a light tray. This free breakfast every morning helped get my day started.\\n\\nI stayed on the second floor so I often took the staircase when I left or returned to my room. I only used the old-style cage elevator when I had to transport my luggage to and from my room.\\n\\nThe lobby/lounge area was roomy. Even though I didn\\'t linger, I noticed that there were always guests present who socialized with each other or just spent the time reading.\\n\\nI didn\\'t try the adjacent Fino (Italian) restaurant but it always seemed busy and well attended every night.\\n\\nI appreciate the 24-hour supply of lobby refreshments ; i.e. iced water, hot water, coffee, assortment of teas and fruits.\\n\\nI liked the hotel\\'s location on quiet Post Street, two blocks northwest of Union Square. The cable car stops on  Powell/Post so it was a convenient hop-on/drop-off location, although I preferred boarding the cable car at  the Powell Street turnaround. Weekend rides were always full and hectic so I indulged riding on Monday (I was in SF from Saturday-Monday). I used my 3-day Fast Pass ($20) for unlimited rides on MUNI buses, streetcar (F-line) and cable car.\\n\\nMy check-out was easy. In the rain, I headed to Powell-BART station that took me directly to SFO airport on my flight back to Los Angeles.\\n\\nOne final thing: I found a discrepancy between the charges on my check-out receipt and bank statement.

We were only there for one night and I have to say it was a very positive experience. As others have said, the rooms are clean and nicely appointed. We stayed in a twin room, in the back, on the sixth floor. It was a little dark, but we heard no noise. We had a tub in our bathroom (which had a window.)

Yes, it is carbs because they are pastries, but they were delicious along with fresh fruit and coffee/juice-all on your floor. The complimentary wine was a nice feature and the bartenders were very friendly. The restaurant Vino is delicious. I know there are so many restaurants to choose from in the city, but if you don\\'t want to go far, it will not disappoint. Lastly, the hotel front desk staff were friendly and helpful.

It was unusually warm during our stay, and there\\'s no A/C.  We opened the windows and turned on the ceiling fan, but that, of course, let in more noise.\\n\\nOlder members of the hotel staff were professional and efficient.  Younger staff were apathetic at best.\\n\\nHonestly, I think I\\'d try someplace else next trip to San Francisco.",2,negative

I have stayed at other hotels in Union Square including the Hilton and the Westin.  Most of the hotels in this area are very old and have a lot of visitors.  Since it was the weekend of the SF Marathon, there was hardly anything available in the area.  We had to pay top price to find this room as it was one of the few available.    At other reviewers suggest, this hotel is very European, everything is smaller compared to larger American chain hotels.  To my surprise, the lobby is small and cozy.  Check in was easy and they had free wi-fi.  The room was tiny. I felt like I was a character in a movie such as Alice in Wonderland where she is so large that she can\\'t fit through the door. OK, that is an exaggeration but the room barely fit a full size bed. Since we must have got the last room, it was in a horrible location (room 205) at the entrance of the stair well and right were they serve the continental breakfast. THere are windows in the room that one, face our neighbors shower and the second that face an small opening (I have seen this in Europe in many of the buildings but I am not sure of what it is called (mini courtyard minus the yard).  It was nice for fresh air or should I say ventilation.  The hotel offers a glass of wine in the evening, a continental breakfast. If you can sleep thought any noise, then stay here but otherwise, if you are a light sleeper such as me then you might not get much sleep even with your white noise app cracked up and half a Costco melatonin in your system.  Also, avoid room 205. In all fairness, when I stayed at the Westin facing Union Square, I heard every shower, and neighbor conversations and that was after I just finished a marathon (so tired and yet still bothered by noise).  If this hotel is in your budget, you will find it is only a couple of blocks to Union Square and transportation. Parking in the back runs about 30 a night.

From the airport, you can take Bart to Powell Street; from there it\\'s a (slightly uphill) ten-minute walk past Union Square to the Andrews, or a three-minute cab ride. One note: The bathroom in my room was fine for me but was exactly the same size as the closet--about three feet wide--and would not have accommodated a large person. Other rooms, though, are laid out differently; ask about this when you make your reservation, and I\\'m sure the friendly hotel staff will be happy to help you select an appropriate room configuration.\\n",5,positive

He gave us a recommendation fort the best Chinese food my wife and I have ever had.

She loved the romance of being in a very old hotel with an old tiny elevator and old creaky floors.  For me it was the opposite....\\n1.  The hotel is located on Post Street in the Tenderloin.  If you never have been in San Francisco, the tenderloin is one of the most run down sections of the city and it is over run by the homeless.  People are sleeping everywhere on the streets and in doorways.  Besides that, Post Street is the major thoroughfare for the Fire Trucks serving that section of the city.  During the night of December 7, 2016 I was awoken by blaring sirens four times during the night, and I mean blaring.  Post street has 3-4 story building on each side and the sirens bounce off the wall with intensity.  In addition, the windows on this old hotel are single pane windows so the sound comes right through.\\n2.  We had room 201 which faces the street and thus all the noise.  I asked for a room in the back with my reservation but upon arrival was told all those room were gone and I checked in at 11:15 am !!!\\n3.  The Bathroom has a sink that is the smallest I have ever seen.  A bar sink is huge compared to this sink.  Besides the bathroom being small, there was a walk in closet off the bathroom that was bigger than the bathroom !!!  Also the toilet is a very small toilet and I would not recommend for any of those who may be somewhat larger than normal.\\n4.  We placed a reservation for a Queen room with a Queen bed, but room 201 only had a double full bed.  Very tight fit sleeping for two.\\n5.  The hotel said &quot;breakfast included&quot;.  Although there is a restaurant on the first floor, what they consider a breakfast is tea or coffee, with a banana or orange and a few sweet rolls.  I was under the impression that a &quot;breakfast&quot; really included eggs, bacon, toast, etc.  This was only a small continental breakfast.\\n6.  The full or double bed was comfortable.\\n7.  The flat screen TV has a small 24 or 27 inch screen.  However, the internet (included) did work well\\n8.  The website says the parking is extra and is $54.00 in cost for overnight.  I did find a parking lot behind the building that was $30.00 for 24 hours.  You can also park at the Union Square Garage for $38 for 24 hours and walk the 3 blocks to the hotel.\\n\\nUnfortunately the night we stayed (a weeknight) was a rainy night and this room was exceptionally noisy and I got no sleep that night.  Due to the noise alone I would not return to this hotel ever again.  I told the receptionist at the lobby desk and she just said she was sorry, shrugged her shoulders and said have a nice day.\\n\\nThere are so many hotels in San Francisco to choose from and this is not one I would recommend (but my wife would just for it San Francisco cuteness)",1,negative

I like character and charm but the standard room was more akin to a small college dorm, if that.  A college dorm is required to have a useable bathroom.\\n\\nThe suite was a hundred times better, but more expensive obviously.  We were allowed to check in to that room immediately that morning which was nice.  However, when my sister asked to retrieve something from the room we had been in just a few hours earlier, the housekeeping staff argued we had not stayed in the room we said we had.  I had the bill that showed otherwise, but the young lady and the front desk just let it go.  It is offensive to be called a liar, just because you left one of your tioletries in the bathroom.\\n\\nThe suite included a fridge and free beverages, which was nice.  Coke, Sprite, bottled water and Diet Coke.  They kept this stocked every morning.  Unfortunately, for two women sharing a room, we were given one shampoo and one conditioner to last us for four nights.  I do not mean one bottle each night, I mean one bottle to last us for four nights.  Two people, one tiny bottle of shampoo, conditioner, and one bar of soap for four nights.  Again, I could have gone to the front desk, but I should not have had to.\\n\\nThe person working the front desk in the morning was polite enough, and called us a taxi when we needed one.  Unfortunately, she also told us our reservation was not what I thought it was:  they had me down for three nights instead of four and the night I did not have a reservation was a Saturday and the hotel was booked solid.   So I had to find another hotel...on a weekend....in San Francisco....that I could afford and could get my bags to.  Not to mention the trouble it will cause with my employer.  \\n\\nI found a hotel down the street, the Beresford Arms, who had a standard room available and similarly priced.  The morning I checked out of the Andrews, the manager said I had another night.  I told him what happened and he apologized but I said I was going to the Beresford.  I am glad I did.  It was beautiful, and the staff was wonderful...the room was the perfect temp, and they actually gave us soap and shampoo.  They also let us check in well before they had to, and had a beautiful breakfast set up for their guests.  \\n\\nForget the Andrews, save yourself and your bladder a hard time - stay at the Beresford Arms.",3,negative

Conveniently located in downtown San Francisco, it is a walking distance to the Greyhound bus station and Union Square. In particular, I liked the healthy breakfast that includes a variety of bread and bagels; spreads in the form of dairy butter, fruit jams, cream cheese, and peanut butter; fruits like apples, strawberries, oranges and bananas; hot beverages as in coffee, tea, and chocolate; cup noodles and more. I wish to say &quot;thank you&quot; to Eric for being approachable and helpful to the guests during breakfast. The free high speed internet is noteworthy. Lockers and linens are provided without extra charge, except a refundable deposit for your own door key. Each comfortable bunk bed has curtains that give some privacy to the occupants. Just a kind suggestion to check the curtain railings if they are intact. Also, it will add freshness to the room if the curtains are changed and washed regularly. I didn\\'t find any inconvenience with the bathrooms and toilets that are shared with other guests on each floor. However, I would suggest the reception staff to be genuinely nice and courteous to the guests. I had a cold welcome from the chubby lady receptionist who seemed to be tired during her night or early morning duty. People know that it isn\\'t easy to give a sincere smile when one is exhausted; but kindly entertain everyone\\'s questions with sincere patience regardless of their race or nationality. In fairness by mid morning, she was nicer; and I admired her being occupied in displaying decorative items and announcements on the wall. Before I checked out, a slim lady receptionist caught my attention, as I observed her to be smiling most of the time when on duty. Nice and approachable indeed, she even helped me collect my luggage and bag from the storeroom. I wish to say thanks again. In general, I had an enjoyable stay.

OUT/com/60713/112318/175194059.html,Adelaide Hostel,"""My second stay at the Adelaide in Aug 13 after visiting in July 12.\\n\\nHostel: Definitely better than average quality and management. Good breakfast is included, even with fresh fruit (Hey, it\\'s California :-). For a hostel, everything is very clean, also the shared bathrooms. Different dorm room sizes. The 6-male I stayed in has new fixings with separated bunk bed &quot;chambers&quot; that have a little curtain, shelf, outlets, and lamp. Each bed has a securable trunk-style box with plenty of space. So the dorm room felt kind of private. Nice! Free &amp; decent WiFi.\\n\\nLocation: Close to many areas in walk-able distance, e.g. China Town or the Powell BART station. I particularly like that the MUNI lines #2 and #3 are close, which run straight to the Richmond area. Area seems to gentrify recently; much more cafes and fancy spots than last time, especially on Post St. Mixed crowds on the street, nothing unusual for folks that live in urban settings. Being close to the Tenderloin doesn\\'t mean it is extra dangerous, just use common sense in neighborhoods you are not familiar with.\\nService: Staff is generally friendly, and the Adelaide nighly programs they offer seem a great add-on, but I did not take part myself to say more. You can store luggage, and they can book an airport shuttle for you for $9, which is great considering that BART costs like $8.50 already.\\n\\nOne star off for charging an extra $1 for paying with a credit card. I found this very tacky - given that you can only reserve with a credit card anyway, so who does really bring a wad of cash to pay?\\n\\nGuests: mixed crowd of world travelers and Californians, in their twenties mostly, but also older or occasional families. Common room is cozy but often strangely silent, as everybody stares into a computer or gadget.\\n\\nWould come back here for another stay. Prices increased a lot in the last year, but also everywhere else in SF...",4,positive

The big lockers under the beds were good. The beds themselves were particularly good - each had a curtain and its own shelf, light, and electricity socket within the bed so that each person had their own private space.

The kitchen is well equipped but everything felt rather sticky and greasy, including all of the work surfaces and the floor.

We got the BART to Powell St. Roughly the same price but the transport takes you door to door but travel time wise can vary depending on how many pick and drop offs it has. \\n\\nStayed in a 4 bed dorm.

One was out of commission whilst we stayed but we were never having to wait around to use the toilet or have a shower\\n\\nBreakfast is included in the rate and there is a good variety. There are bagels, cinnamon bread, porridge/oatmeal, orange juice and fruit as well as tea and coffee. There are a range of jams and cream cheese to go with them. The hotel as social events during the week. There are movie nights, pasta dinner nights and twin peaks tour. Didn\\'t manage any of them because we were so tired from our days out. There is free wifi.\\n\\nThe hostel also have a deal for half price bike rentals from a place just around the corner where we got a bike for the day for $16, normally $32 so do ask at reception if you are wanting to cycle around San Fran and over the Golden Gate bridge. \\n\\nYou have to strip your bedding when you leave and tha\\'ts when we were quite shocked with the state of the pillows and the stains on them and the mattresses.

Of the 4 beds we had, one was a double with bunk, which anybody over 5\\'6 would not fit in, the single was a sheet of foam over a ensamble bizarrely wrapped in plastic, and finally a double which in our case had to sleep 2 guys over 5\\'6. The service was terrible, rude, and patronizing. The Internet stopped working after we\\'d been there for 24 hrs, we had 7 different devices that couldn\\'t connect. When I went down to ask if there was a problem, the guy at the desk just told me I must have a problem, he\\'d just got there and had connected to all of them he said. This must have been just before he turned them all off to get enough bandwidth to sit at the desk and play Warcraft! Ignoring plenty of other people looking for assistance.

That brings the total cost with parking to $85-90 for a dorm bed!\\n\\nNo key to the room was given.  Per the front desk person, Natalie, they apparently didn\\u2019t know where the other keys to the room door were but they would be happy to let me in and out as I needed (which is especially handy if you need to go to restroom, the door autolocks behind you and you have to go up and down a steep flight of stairs to get back in EVERY TIME). I told her as much and also that it didn\\u2019t make me feel secure that the keys to the room I would be in were missing.  I asked if I could be moved to another room with a key and she seemed utterly bewildered.\\n\\nShe informed me that it\\u2019s not that the keys were stolen/lost but that the owner doesn\\u2019t provide them with enough keys.  So either you have an owner who maxes out rooms without having enough keys for guests or the other keys are floating around GOD knows where.  Neither situation is good.\\n\\nAs it was late, I was tired and it was just for 1 night, I said whatever and went up.  Now, if you are under 6\\u2019 5\\u201d tall you may not want to stay here if you can\\u2019t get a bottom bunk.  The top of the ladder to the upper bunks was up to my waist.   The upper bunk was so high in fact that you couldn\\u2019t even stretch to set anything on top of the bunk.  \\n\\nThere were wooden lockers on the floor, however the process of getting up and down the ladder was so awesome it made more sense to bring up anything you wanted with you the first go.

I explained I was not given a key.  He replied that that didn\\u2019t make sense and that I had to have had a key.  (It was so nice of Natalie to not notate that she never gave me a key.)  I explained what had occurred .  He said okay and proceeded to check me out.  Only he wasn\\u2019t able to do so.  Apparently, me not having a key caused his brain to scramble and such concepts as looking up my reservation by my name was very foreign and difficult for him to do.

When we came back, we asked what to do with the car if the Hertz location was closed. Elizabeth at the Adelaide told us they could arrange to put it in a lot for $16.

Our biggest gripe with this was that ALL of the common space, including laundry, kitchen, and lounge are ALL in the Adelaide.  So if you want to hang out, you have to walk a block every time...  This also causes the common space at the Adelaide to become EXTREMELY CROWDED.  As they are fitting 3 hotels worth of people into one common area.

A dorm bed in a crowded hostel can easily cost more than US$50 (and usually the prices you first see do not include taxes, which can add up to 20% more).\\n\\nThus, I am glad to find a night at Adelaide Hostel in March cost less than $40 for a dorm bed (Though I think in busier season it can cost more, much more).\\n\\nThe best thing about Adelaide Hostel is that it is quite close to Union Square. It is also walking distance to Powell Street BART/MUNI station.  A Cable Car line is just around the corner. \\n\\nThe hostel itself is hidden in an alleyway. It is not very big and has very narrow stairways (not easy if you carry a big suitcase). The upstair (ground floor) lounge is comfy and feel just a friend\\'s living room. Kitchen and dining room are in basement where space is quite tight. \\n\\nI stay in a dorm room on the basement level. The room is relatively tight and dark. However, the bed is all right and easy to sleep on. I do have problems with the ladder for bunker bed. It is narrow and difficult to cling to. For people sleeping in upper bunkbed, you may need to be careful when you try to climb out of the bed and get down.\\n\\nThe breakfast is included and rather basic (juice, coffee/tea, bread, butter and spread, cereal etc.) However, there are quite a few places outside you can eat.\\n\\nOverall, Adelaide Hostel is not so wonderful or memorable as the Freehand or Jones franchises I stay in Chicago.

The breakfast is impressive: your choice of unlimited bagels, toast, english muffins, oatmeal, fruit, orange juice and about 5 different flavors of jelly/jam, nutella, peanut butter, whipped butter, margarine and cream cheese to put on top. I stayed in a 6 bed female dorm which had pretty comfortable beds and little curtains you can pull to feel like you have a bit more privacy. The dorm room lockers fit your entire backpack, and more, so you can just store everything without worrying. My only complaint would be that the bathroom facilities are a bit tight and you have to be careful maneuvering to avoid hitting the walls and shower curtains. But even still, there are several available and I never had to wait to use a toilet, or shower.

The Dakota\\'s rooms are a small upgrade from sleeping on the street in a sleeping bag.\\n\\nThe only reason I give the Adelaide 2 stars is because I stayed there in 2007 as a college student, and the experience was adequate for one in that stage of life looking for a cheap place to spend a night in the heart of an expensive city.  So I blame myself when, five years later, I planned a week long getaway for my husband and myself and booked two nights in a private room here expecting the same budget experience.  We quickly realized that we no longer prefer this setting and are unable to relax in dirty, noisy &quot;hotels.&quot;  \\n\\nLike everyone before me has stated, understand that if you book a private room, you are not really staying at the Adelaide hostel.  You have to check in at the Adelaide, but you walk a block north to the Dakota Hotel with your bags.  The Dakota has a smidgeon of appeal if you like ancient hotels that &quot;preserve&quot; antiquated details, such as the lift in the lobby which only sometimes works and is more than a little scary.\\n\\nDespite having much to say, I will keep this short, as others before me have described basically down to the last detail my very own experience.  The street noise is terrible, the front rooms are directly above a bar, there is no air conditioning, the bed sheets and covers are full of holes and stains, the pillows lumpy, the mattresses worn out.  Our ceiling fan was broken so we had to sleep with windows open, which only made the traffic noise even worse.  The staff was average, but this isn\\'t a four or five star hotel, so why expect anything better?  The cleanliness of the room was... severely lacking.  I never took my shoes off for fear of touching the carpet with my bare feet.\\n\\nFor us as a couple, it was $40 per person ($80 per night + taxes), and is $55 per person on weekends.  We cancelled our second night\\'s stay, requested a refund (pending), and moved to another hotel where we paid quite a bit more, but had a real night\\'s sleep in clean and well-furnished room.  \\n\\nMy advice is that unless you are a student or a single person desiring a HOSTEL experience, or unable to afford ANYTHING better, do not book a private room here.

I only stayed in the main building, so can\\'t comment on their second location (the Dakota residence, which is one block away), but judging by the reviews, it looks like I got the better deal. You can hear a reasonable amount of street noise, but nothing a pair of earplugs wouldn\\'t kill. The private rooms are all en-suite and the standard was as good as a hotel in my opinion - modern, comfortable, clean and well-maintained. A TV was included, as was complementary mineral water and toothpaste. \\n\\nThere is a kitchen downstairs for preparing and storing food. You can buy basics from the Walgreens on the corner or there is a Trader Joe\\'s about 15 minutes\\' walk away. The breakfast is the best I\\'ve ever seen in a hostel. Homemade oatmeal, a wide selection of breads and spreads, fruit, hot drinks - all high quality. It does tend to get pretty crowded after 9.00am though, so getting there earlier is advisable. \\n\\nThe dorm I stayed in was exceptional. This hostel has clearly been designed by someone who has been travelling and knows exactly what travellers want. Each bed has curtains around it, and within your unit you get your own shelf, mirror and reading light. There are also under-bed storage lockers, which are big enough to fit two large suitcases. There is a sink in each room and several bathrooms along the corridor (some of which have only either a toilet or a shower), and a hairdryer is available. Towels cost extra, but given the standard of accommodation, it\\'s a small price to pay. \\n\\nThere are lots of social activities taking place on a nightly basis (pub crawls, wine and cheese parties &amp;c, plus free dinners). However, there are a mixed group of people staying here - it\\'s not just youngsters. I didn\\'t have any issues with noise from the other guests. The common area is relaxing and inviting with lots of comfy chairs. The wifi generally worked well, although the signal was a bit weak in the dorm.\\n\\nTransport-wise, there are several local buses running near the hostel and the BART station and cable car are about 10 minutes\\' walk away. You can get a cheap shuttle service to the airport. As I didn\\'t come by car, I can\\'t comment on the parking, but I imagine it would be restricted and/or expensive given the location. Talking of which, be careful walking too far down Taylor Street (as you turn right out of the hostel).

I wandered into it accidentally and it was a very unnerving experience (I\\'ve been to all the large US cities, and this particular vicinity was one of the worst I\\'ve encountered). However, if you avoid that, the rest of the surrounding area is safe and usually very busy. Most of the shops are chains and the restaurants are ok, if not particularly characterful.\\n\\nThe only reason I\\'m giving this place four stars is because, unfortunately, there was definitely a bed bug issue. Over the course of my time there, I woke up almost every day with fresh bites on my face, arms and legs. This is by no means an unusual occurrence in hostels, and I wouldn\\'t want to deter anyone from staying here because the standard of accommodation is so high for what you pay. I suspect I was probably just unlucky. The staff were, in the main, friendly and helpful (particularly the Chinese girl with blonde hair and the manager), although there were a couple of sullen, moody types (notably the Irish guy who made the breakfast, who looked bored to tears). Overall, I would rate Adelaide Hostel highly and recommend it to budget travellers.",4,positive

So I booked a dorm bed on their website and looked forward to my first night on my California road trip. When I arrived at the small courtyard where the entrance is located I was welcomed by the smell of garbadge and weed. However the receiption and the attached lounge area inside the hostel looked clean and cozy. The friendly and helpful staff informed me that my room would be situated in the Dakota hostel which is just round the corner. That of course was a surprise. But as it was close by, i didn\\'t mind going there. The inside of the Dakota Hostel looked not as good as the Adelaide, but still ok. I wouldn\\'t call it clean, I wouldn\\'t call it nice. I would call it just acceptable. But it was definitely not worth the price of 66,96 USD (inc. tax)  per night. The wifi and the computer didn\\'t work so I had to return to the Adelaide to sort out some things before going back to sleep. The worst and for me the most important issue about this hostel is the missing security measures at the Dakota. Everybody can get in and enter your room. This finally had a stake in my wallet being emptied over night. Although this incident was mainly my own fault (being jet lagged I forgot to put it out of my trousers to my other valuables at a safe place) the security conditions at the hostel contributed to it, I think.

Honestly, we didn\\'t see hotel personal after we checked in and, aside from breakfast room, we didn\\'t see other guests!  All in all, I am glad we stayed there.  I prefer a bed / breakfast to large hotel for my romantic get-a-ways!  This one is out of the way from the normal sight-seeing crowds and we very much appreciated the quiet.",4,positive
OUT/com/60713/112311/313560842.html,Jackson Court San Francisco,"""Two night stay at Jackson court as a treat at the end of a great holiday. We had previously been staying in a more central Hostel and this was a lovely change! \\n\\nThe building is beautiful and well kept, and the rooms are fantastically luxurious. We had an upstairs superior room (The Blue Room, number 8) which was huge and comfortable. The en-suite was small but a great use of the limited space (I assume it used to be a cupboard), but that did mean the sink was in the main room. This didn\\'t present a problem to us, but may be something other people would find odd! The room was lovely and quiet.\\n\\nThe service was good if not exceptional, as the gentlemen greeting us was less than enthusiastic. He was unable to operate the card machine correctly and did not fill me with confidence that he wasn\\'t going to accidentally take payment twice! This issue was easily resolved with the manager. \\n\\nAnother slight issue was the lack of lift or porter in the building (this may explain the attitude of the receptionist!!), which meant bags needed to be manhandled up the two flight of stairs to our room. Again this did not present a problem for me, and the receptionist assisted with my partners bags but should be considered for visitors of more advanced years.\\n\\nThe breakfast was laid out is a small self service kitchen and was pleasant. The kitchen was a very handy addition for us, as it meant we could make tea and store things in the fridge.\\n\\nThe cleaning staff were excellent and very attentive. On the first morning we were a bit late going down for breakfast, but they kindly waited for us to finish before cleaning up. They also called the room later in the morning to ask when we would like the room to be serviced. I was impressed.\\n\\nThe location is excellent, as long as you have good legs! Jackson court is located at the top of a hill in the Pacific Heights area of San Francisco. Union Street (not square) is a few blocks down the hill and has great shops, restaurants and bars to explore away for the majority of tourists. If you continue down the hill you will end up in Fisherman\\'s Wharf - the other end of the spectrum! Getting back up the hill is another matter...\\n\\nAll in all, a very pleasant end to a brilliant holiday :-)",4,positive

It has an old world feel and that it lovely.  The staff couldn\\'t be more accommodating.  Beds are firm, showers excellent.  Nice kitchen for complementary continental breakfast. Easy walk to Fillmore and Union Streets with lots of restaurants and shops.  Importantly the Jackson Court is reasonably priced!  Hard to find in SF.

OUT/com/60713/112311/588436575.html,Jackson Court San Francisco,"""The staff are so helpful, welcoming and genuinely care about their guests.  The continental breakfast each day was delicious!  The cut up fruit was so fresh and the muffins were very good - glad that I had the hills of San Francisco to work them off.  We got there a bit before check-in but they had our room ready.  It was on the 3rd floor and we totally did not expect the young man to help with our bags but he insisted.  He helped us to figure out the website to pay for the toll across the Golden Gate bridge so that we would not have to let the rental car company pick that up and add their charges.  He let us know that the Bay to Breakers marathon was the next morning and advise what roads would help us to get out of the city for our three day trip to San Jose, San Simeon, Monterey and Carmel by the Sea.  Parking that first night wasn\\'t too bad on the street but we were grateful to drop the car back off at the airport at the end of our three day adventure.  We used the Bart system to get back into town and then did a 2 day hop/on-hop/off bus and night tour.  The first day we rode around the city to decide where we would get off the next day.  That evening we took a $12 cab ride from Union Square back to Jackson Court.  We also used the city buses in the days that followed to get close to our destinations.  I will warn you that after 6:30 buses are not allowed in the Pacific Heights area to minimize the noise.  Each day between 3:30 and 6:30 Jackson Court had tea and cookies in the main room.  They would light a small fire in the fireplace and play relaxing music.  I felt like royalty.  The also left Hershey Kisses by the front door and those were a nice treat at the end of the day.  There is a laundry mat just on the next block.  The kitchen is on the second floor and can be used to refrigerate or heat up leftover dinners.  There is an filtered water machine that distributes cold and hot water.  Before we came to Jackson Court, I read reviews back to 2007 and I think there were only two that were not good.  Do no miss the opportunity to stay at Jackson Court - it was a wonderful experience!",5,positive
OUT/com/60713/112311/384281811.html,Jackson Court San Francisco,"""This is an old San Francisco home that has been remodeled into a quasi-bed &amp; breakfast. The rooms are well appointed with old fashion furniture, antique type pictures, and historic memorabilia.  The morning breakfast is a basic fresh fruit, bread and cereal bar with coffee, tea and juices. Not real fancy but fresh and filling. The employees are very friendly, helpful and can provide lots of great tourist advice. The only downside to this hotel is that there is no elevator and all the rooms are on the 2nd and 3rd floor. You need to hump your bags up the stairs to your room. Sometimes there is hotel help and sometimes you end up doing it yourself.  The hotel is very close to a number of the trendy areas of San Francisco. We would stay here again, just bring fewer suitcases.",4,positive

There is no elevator but this did not pose a problem for us. Sparkling apple juice was on a tray waiting for us upon our arrival which was a nice touch. The street is located in a nice area and quiet enough to leave the windows open at night. Usually in San Fran. air conditioning is not required but if so, a large fan was in the closet for our use. The main entrance leads to a large sitting area with a fireplace and apples in a bowl for those interested in a snack at night. The breakfast was self serve and included fresh fruit, breads,muffins and cereal etc.Perfect!",4,positive

I chose the location based on friends living nearby, but the charm of the building and neighborhood were definitely pluses. Continental breakfast of coffee, juice, yogurt, cut fruit, breads, bagels, muffins, peanut butter, cottage cheese, etc. was light, but enough to get us up and out. Please note that room 4 (Jackson Room) is right next to the breakfast room so you will hear noise between staff set up (around 7am) and guests chatting while having breakfast (7:30am onwards).

Nearby Fillmore St (walking distance) had many excellent restaurants, and is far removed from the usual tourist options. The only challenge is parking in the neighbourhood.",4,positive
OUT/com/60713/112311/499286738.html,Jackson Court San Francisco,"""I stayed at the Jackson Court Inn for 4 days at the end of June and the beginning of July 2017.  My reason for visiting San Francisco was to visit my daughter and I specifically chose the Jackson Court because it was 4 blocks away from my daughter\\u2019s apartment.  Unfortunately, I did not realize that there were four very steep blocks between my hotel and my daughter\\u2019s apartment.  Nonetheless, this proved to not be that much of an issue.\\n\\nI arrived in the afternoon and was greeted nicely by a reception staff member.  It took only minutes to check-in, and I was soon escorted to Room 3, the Library Room, on the 2nd floor.  The hotel has a traditional Bed and Breakfast feel with multiple sitting areas on the first and second floors.  My room faced the front on Jackson Street, and featured a Queen sized bed, a sofa sitting area with wood burning fireplace, TV, and desk as well as bathroom with shower.  I felt that I had a good amount of room, and I enjoyed the TV sitting area.  The room was nicely furnished and very clean.    There were adequate towels and amenities in the bathroom.  I was able to find various outlets to charge my electronics, and I found that the Internet Wifi was adequate for checking emails and downloading files.  Overall the the hotel was very comfortable and quiet throughout my stay.\\n\\nThere was a separate room on the second floor for breakfast, which I made use of each morning.  The continental breakfast included croissants muffins, breads, cereals, fruit, juices, tea, and coffee.  It was plenty for me, and I enjoyed having a little something to eat before I left each day.  \\n\\nI think the main reason to stay at the Jackson Court Inn is because you have business or are visiting someone in the Pacific Heights area.  It is a long walk to touristy areas such as Fisherman\\u2019s Wharf and downtown.  You can easily walk to Fillmore Street, but a walk to Cow Hollow area will require navigating 5 steep blocks up and down.  I did not have a car, but if you bring one, you will have to park on the street and follow the many parking regulations posted in the area.  Nonetheless, getting around the city without a car was not a problem because I found it very easy to summon an Uber driver to get me to areas I needed to go.  Overall, I really enjoyed this place and appreciated the homey feel.  It was a really nice place to stay, and I will definitely stay here again the next time I visit my daughter in San Francisco.",4,positive

OUT/com/60713/112311/142979717.html,Jackson Court San Francisco,"""My partner and I stayed here in 2012 October. We were in the blue room (#8). It was a large room, new flat screen TV, large closet with dresser and 2 racks for suitcases and lots of hanging space for clothes. Bed (queen) was comfy. Bath had a good size shower, no bathtub. It was the  first time we had been to a B&amp;B. The entrance and common areas were very nice, deep rich dark wood and the area (Pacific Height) is surrounded with million dollar homes. Just stunning. We decided to  walk to Fishermans Warf upon arrival to see the neighbourhood and get a feel for the city. It was downhill and we strolled and took about 35-40 minutes. All downhill. Returning I would recommend the bus as uphill .Breakfast was a nice start to the day it included, juice, milk, toast, coffee, muffins, croissants, yougart, granola, cereal. Tea and cookies are served at 3:30. We really enjoyed having tea in the library. We did not have a vehicle and we purchased the City Pass (we were there for 5 days), which was an awesome deal. Bus drivers so friendly and helpful. Bus stops close by. Be adivsed that evening buses (the #10) only runs mon to fri until 7pm. So you will need to walk a few short blocks back to the B&amp;B if your returning back after that time.  There may have been another bus but were not aware of it. It was our first visit to San Francisco so took a bit to understand the bus system. We loved the location, residential but close walk to Union St and shopping, a good stroll to Pier 39 and the house is authentic. I would stay here again for sure. The staff friendly, helpful. It was very quiet in the home, we did meet a few of the quests in the common kitchen at breakfast. There are trays to take your breakfast back to your room if you choose. As a reminder, this is an old home so dont expect modern furnishings and everything with straight clean lines (although tv\\'s are new flat screen), the orginal hardwood floors squeak but its solid. The only thing I would state as not a positive was the blue wallpaper in bathroom could use a change and thats me just being picky.",4,positive
