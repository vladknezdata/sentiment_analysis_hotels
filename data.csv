My room was simply chic, with a minimalist touch. Designed to give you exactly what you need with no unnecessary elements. And &quot;The Blond&quot; (lounge/club) is a must see!

It\\'s so minimalist, we didn\\'t know we were in it:)  The very welcoming young hip valet checked us in on his iPad and we whisked up to our room.  It was modern, minimalist and nearly roomy.  The bathroom was larger then we expected and sported sleek brass fixtures - brass is back!  Rustic chic \\'logs\\' served as side tables, however my side lacked an outlet so I either abandoned my phone waaay over on the desk or ran down the battery having it close to me.  The concierge level provides an elegant subdued retreat from the bustle of the city and it was always stocked with newspapers and lovely orange scented water.  Apparently they offer breakfast too, but I never partake.  The location is super if you\\'re into SoHo/West Village like we are.  Down Lafayette a few blocks and you\\'ll find some of NYC\\'s best restaurants.  The real hit however, was the super service.  We aren\\'t exactly chic: I\\'m 54 and my husband\\'s disability lead us to use a scooter.  The hotel staff couldn\\'t be more accommodating: helping us push the thing when its juice ran out and storing it plugged in overnight before we figured out we could actually fit it in our room.  All that from these young hip beautiful people who didn\\'t make us feel old:)  We ended up extending our stay because we just couldn\\'t leave NYC, in no small part to our fantastic experience at the hotel.",5,positive

Where to start ? 11H is the quintessential trendy boutique hotel in NYC. Idealy located in Soho, the place is stunning, decorated with a lot of taste, feeling like it has been here for ever but at the same time like no other. The main entrance doesn\\'t have the typical reception counter, you\\'re greeted by the friendly staff in a modern space that makes you feel like you are entering your home building. The front desk is smartly located on the second floor in a very loungy space they call the library. The staff is the friendliest and coolest I even met, considering the place opened so recently, I wasn\\'t expecting so much professionalism and reactivity to all our requests. I got the chance to meet the General Manager during breakfast, we was very nice to us and making sure we had everything we wanted. The rooms have everything we needed, very clean, bright, quiet and confortable (important detail: very accessible power plugs for charging phones next to beds). Last but not least, we enjoyed a few nights at le blond, the bar/club located on the second floor. The crowd and atmosphere was excellent.",5,positive

The hotel has a very different lobby setup than you\\'re used to - there\\'s a round table with free-floating staff to assist you with anything you need, including check-in/-out, bag storage, etc.\\n\\nThe hotel (and the staff) is very modern chic - it looks and feels new, and the rooms are great. If you\\'re looking at the design, you can definitely see what they\\'re referring to when the 11 Howard mentions their &quot;Scandinavian design&quot; influences - it\\'s all very nice, and it\\'s distinct from other hotels you\\'ve been to (not in a better or worse way - just a different design style way). I love the tablet in the rooms used to do everything from scheduling cleanings to room service to exploring the nearby area - it\\'s very convenient!\\n\\nIf you\\'re sensitive to sound, request a high floor or quiet room. Certain rooms in the hotel are subject to the &quot;subway shakes&quot; - think of those as subtle deep bass tones. You won\\'t feel the room vibrate or anything, but you can hear the deep vibration of the subway trains passing somewhere underneath about every hour. It won\\'t distract or bother a heavy sleeper, but some people might be more sensitive to it.\\n\\nAs for the staff, every single person I interacted with was excellent, friendly, and fun. Well above your stereotypical service. Note though that they can blend in with any normal person you would see staying at the hotel. There\\'s no standard outfit per se, though you can see the uniform/pattern in the trendy style each of them sports. Just another unique feature of the 11 Howard.",5,positive

Our room had two super-comfortable queen-size beds. Bathroom amenities and toiletries were excellent. We were on the 9th floor, there is some amount of noise coming in from the street and the subway line below, but not much by NYC standards (certainly much more quiet than most Midtown locations!) Wi-fi is free and fast. There\\'s plenty of restaurants, cafes and bars within a few blocks of the hotel, and there\\'s a subway station two blocks away. Highly recommended.

However, it is always a challenge looking for lodging here, as you never know what you;re going to get in the same hotel - and I continually try out new places as there are so many choices, \\nThis place looked promising as it came up at a fair price on a website and appears to be offering what appears to be a promotional rate.  \\nThe location is nice, being near subways, Little Italy, and SoHo.  \\nThe door people and staff are well trained and polite.\\nHowever, first bad thing - my brother is visiting me, and I requested two beds well in advance, but I didn\\'t get what I asked for, and there are no rollaways, no couch, no way to not sleep in the same bed, and thus we are sharing a bed, something I haven\\'t done since we were kids. \\nSecond bad thing is that I tried to check in early and I sat in the library, a second floor common room which is quite nice, and I asked them to inform me when my room was ready and.....they forgot.  So I sat around for three hours, one of them unnecessarily since my room was ready which I was sitting around.  \\nTHe bump in the road after that was that they hadn\\'t brought my luggage to the room either, so there\\'s that. \\nHowever, I was ready to forgive all that because everyone here is so nice but - there\\'s an additional part to this narrative that is a failure of the hotel that ruined my trip.  Call me sensitive, but I guess I\\'m not used to being insulted my a hotel., \\n\\nSpecifically, this evening, I  had a lovely meal outin the neighborhood with my brother, and part of the hotel experience that is advertised by 11 Howard in its promotional literature  is that there is a trendy bar attached, called &quot;The Blond&quot;, and which I was looking forward to as part of closing out the evening visit with my brother. \\nExcept, when we waited at the velvet ropes, hello, the bouncers didn\\'t even bother to look up at me. \\nNow, I know I\\'m just a simple person from a small provincial town (San Francisco) and not trendy or important  (I manage money)  and was just looking for a night cap at a trendy new york bar that\\'s attached to the hotel who was refused service but the bar is advertised in all of the hotel literature as being an amenity of the hotel, which makes it downright deceptive and fraudulent.

The physical space - rooms, library, entry lobby - are all beautiful with many subtle details that set this hotel apart from a W or a JW Marriott, such as the leather wrapped handles on the entry doors.  The staff was young, and eager to please, always there to open a door, hail a cab or ask if you were being helped. The rooms are small - but, hey, this is a NY hotel - but are attractive with clean lines and light wood interiors.  Bed was very comfortable!  The workout area is split it into three small rooms on the 3rd floor - one each for yoga, weights and aerobic exercise.  Each room is very small, so if you would like to get a real workout in, probably better to just go for a run outside.  Also, the aerobic room had two treadmills and one elliptical machine, but no stationery bike and the room barely has space for these three side-by-side.  The weight room was essentially a rack of dumbbells and one weight bench, nothing else.  The minor service gaff I mentioned was due to a recent change in policy from offering complimentary conti breakfast in the library to a &quot;charge to your room&quot; policy.  When I entered the library, I was told it was complimentary, only to have another employee rush up to me when I left to ask me my room number, so I could be charged.

We\\u2019ve been to NYC several times (without the baby) for work/pleasure and have stayed in this area and the Times Square area, but this was our first time here with our son. We had a sense that the accommodation size was bigger than usual for NYC as it is a residence property, so that was the first positive sign prior to arriving. I knew I\\u2019d need assistance with a crib and groceries, and when I emailed the Front Office Manager\\u2019s account, I was lucky to get to speak to Yissel &amp; Sophy over the course of a week prior to arriving. Their willingness to help me almost seemed too good to be true - but it wasn\\u2019t! When we arrived, our fridge was stocked and the crib was set up, not to mention the incredible hospitality of the staff who greeted and helped us with our luggage and check-in close to midnight after a full day of travel (and delays) with an infant.\\n\\nThe room was even better than expected. Modern decor, full kitchen stocked with everything we needed for a week (including a fridge, stovetop, dishwasher, kettle, keurig, etc.). The room size for our suite was perfect as it has a divider between the living and bedroom. The upstairs lounge serves free coffee all morning with some snacks, and the rooftop seating area (and view) was a treat. \\n\\nThe location is just a few blocks from Wall Street and the 9/11 Memorial, and everything was accessible with a stroller. The attached restaurant also happily accommodated us with our son for lunch, and the staff was incredibly attentive. \\n\\nThere are so many other good things I could say about the property, staff, and location, but I\\u2019ll leave by saying we hope to return soon, and would suggest this hotel for work or pleasure, and for families needing more space and hospitality than they might expect from some NYC hotels, AKA Wall Street went above and beyond for us, so we would highly recommend.

OUT/com/60763/10039979/582235029.html,AKA Wall Street,"""My daughter and I stayed at the AKA Wall Street for 14 days.  Initially, we were not happy as we had a room that was at the back of the building and it was very dark and gloomy.  I requested a room that was brighter, and as soon as a room became available, we were moved to a much nicer room, 807, which was at the front of the building and had lots of closet space.  So here are the positives of the property from my perspective:  clean rooms, comfortable beds, adequate kitchen facilities (see my suggestions below), great staff who were ALL very helpful, informative, and friendly (Sebastian, you\\'re the best!!), the washing and dryer room (free to the guests!!), the gym, and the business centre.  Also, it rained a lot while we were there, and there were always plenty of umbrellas.  The negatives were the subway train runs below the building (not a &quot;train\\' smash, as eventually, you get used to it and stop hearing the noise and feeling the rumble); the fact that you don\\'t get daily cleaning service unless you pay extra for it (given the cost of the hotel, the cleaning service should be included in the price); the towels provided are not the best quality; and there is nothing to put your laundry in to carry it to the laundry centre.  My suggestions to make the place even better and more like a home away from home are as follows:  (1) add a laundry basket or bag to each room; (2) provide softer towels; (3) consider creating an area on the top floor where the daily coffee is provided called &quot;The Pantry&quot; where guests can leave their non-perishables to be used by incoming guests, and certain kitchen items can be borrowed and returned; and (4) a laundry washing service (an option for an additional cost).  When I left, I took with me the salt, pepper, garlic salt and cinnamon that I bought while there.  However,  I would have preferred to have left them for another guest to use while there.  Also, it would have been nice to have had a measuring cup, measuring spoons and some baking dishes.  As these types of items may not be commonly used by guests, they could be made available in &quot;The Pantry&quot; on an as needed basis. \\n\\nAll in all, it was a great stay.  I will definitely look to stay at another AKA property for my next trip to the U.S.  I usually stay more than 2 weeks for each visit, and having the option to cook and feel like I was at home was wonderful!

There is a kitchen, including a cooktop to prepare food, but despite plenty of space for a proper table, there isn\\'t one. The only place to eat your meal is at the desk or on the couch with your plate in your lap. The coffee table is too low to eat at.

How did no one ever notice this?\\n\\nThere are two televisions, but they operate with different remotes and evidently have different capabilities. The TV on the sleeping side of the room did not have cable tv access, so it was effectively useless. How can one side of a hotel room have cable access but not the other side? Why not have identical TVs with identical access that function with a single remote?

Easy on street parking since it was the weekend I\\'m sure it\\'s not as easy during the weekday. Happy there was a Starbucks about a block and a half away!!. Check in was easy and was greeted in a timely and friendly manner. You can tell it\\'s a brand new hotel by how clean and modern it is and by the tile on the floors. Me and husband reserved a studio and asked for highest floor available and was given a studio on the 4th floor so pretty much no view but that was not an issue for us. The room was pretty clean however having just renovated our own home we can tell some things weren\\'t completely finished. The tiles in the bathroom still needed the thin set to be cleaned off and the corking was all over the place. The floor in the bathroom felt like cement so we just put  two bath mats down. Shower pressure was great. There was pretty much anything you would find in a long stay hotel including stove fridge with freezer, microwave, dishwasher with all utensils and pots a pans needed for cooking. The bed was comfortable and they do have blackout shades. I loved that they had two flat screen tvs so my husband could watch his ESPN show while I caught the news in the morning. The only negative for the room is the outlets weren\\'t next to the bed so my phone was plugged in but not in reaching distance from the bed. There were two outlets behind the bed but we would\\'ve had to move the bed out. Secondly the subway is right underneath the building so you can hear the train passing through however it did not wake us up from our sleep.
